Avicii, born Tim Bergling in 1989, was still in his prime and a rising success in the world of house and EDM music when he decided to cut his career short. In his statement, Avicii expressed how he'd focus on taking care of himself while still pursuing his passion for producing, saying, "I know I am blessed to be able to travel all around the world and perform, but I have too little left for the life of a real person behind the artist. I will however never let go of music — I will continue to speak to my fans through it."</p><p>For years, the strain of touring wore on Avicii, which made him drink, sent him to the hospital, and resulted in the cancellation of shows, as per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. In 2017, a documentary called Avicii: True Stories exposed the stress and anxiety the house music superstar was battling (via the <a href=#>Independent</a>). After Avicii retired, the Swedish DJ built a studio on a vineyard in Tuscany and worked on new tracks from home. Everyone who spent time with him during his final days said he seemed inspired, happy, healthy, and in charge of his life. However, he was still suffering, and in 2018, while visiting friends in Oman, Avicii committed suicide.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline​ at​ 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BmG9ubXBfqb%2Bis8icZJ2dpJa2rb%2BMmpmoraRiwamx0p5kn5mdpMK0ecOjqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
