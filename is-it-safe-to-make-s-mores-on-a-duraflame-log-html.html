Campfire Roasting Logs from Duraflame provide all of the warmth and ambience of a real wood fire without the mess or hassle. Cooking over a robust, wood-like fire produces hot, glowing coals that are safe to use for roasting marshmallows, hot dogs, and other campfire fare.<span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>In a similar vein, you might wonder if Duraflame logs are harmful to your fireplace.<span></span></p><p>It is possible that burning more than one log at a time will result in an excessively large or hot fire in your fireplace. Duraflame firelogs should not be used as starter materials for a wood fire, as they may cause the fire to smoulder. When compared to other types of firelogs, a duraflame firelog contains more fuel content than is required to start a wood fire.<span></span></p><p>&nbsp;<span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Furthermore, what is the composition of Duraflame logs?</h3><p>&nbsp;Duraflame firelogs are made from a scientific blend of sawdust, wax, and special fibres to provide a long-lasting flame. Recycling fibres such as nut shells, seeds, fruit pits, distillery grains, and recycled cardboard have all been tested, and some of the results have been interesting. To create the crackling sounds of a wood fire, some logs have natural seed mixed in with them.<span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>In addition, is it safe to cook over a starter log without burning yourself?</h3><p>The majority of common fire logs, such as a regular Duraflame Firelog, should not be used for cooking. They can impart a funky flavour to your food because of the residue left on them, and because they generally produce only a flame and no coals, they aren’t the best fire logs for cooking in the first place.<span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>How do you put out Duraflame logs?</h3><p>To put out a Duraflame log, carefully douse the log with water or sand. If one is available, use a dry chemical fire extinguisher. Douse the entire log with water to put the fire out. Continue pouring until the hissing sound stops, and all the embers are out.<span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Do fire logs cause cancer?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Wood and synthetic logs are sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which cause mammary cancer in animal experiments. Both contribute to residential air pollution, but researchers found that only the synthetic logs were found to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.<span></span></p><p>&nbsp;<span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Do Duraflame logs produce carbon monoxide?</h3><p>Other sites state that frequently burning fire logs (and even wood) can pose some health concerns. The carbon monoxide emitted can cause symptoms including headaches, dizziness or nasuea. The Duraflame site states that, “…they only burn with flames and do not generate adequate coals for cooking.”<span></span></p><p>&nbsp;<span></span></p><h3>How long do Duraflame logs burn?</h3><p>three hours<span></span></p><p>&nbsp;<span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Are Duraflame logs warm?</h3><p>However, firelogs don’t produce as much of one of the most beneficial byproducts of burning wood: heat. During the same three-hour burn with cordwood, you could use up to 25 pounds of split logs, generating a whole lot more heat per fire.<span></span></p><p>&nbsp;<span></span></p><h3>How do you clean ashes from a fireplace?</h3><p>To remove, simply shovel up the ashes, place them in a bag, and dispose in the trash. If your fireplace has an ash dump, push the ashes through the metal plate in the floor of the firebox. Use a vacuum to clean up the remaining ashes in the firebox and on the hearth.<span></span></p><p>&nbsp;<span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>How are enviro logs made?</h3><p>Enviro-Log Fire Logs are made of 100 percent recycled waxed cardboard and when compared to firewood, Enviro-Logs burn cleaner, emitting 30 percent less greenhouse gases, 80 percent less carbon dioxide and 86 percent less creosote. Enviro-Logs generate 50 percent more heat per pound than firewood and are also safe to cook over.<span></span></p><p>&nbsp;<span></span></p><h3>How do fire logs work?</h3><p>Firelogs are designed to be inexpensive, while being easier to ignite, and burn longer, and more efficiently than firewood. Firelogs are traditionally manufactured using two methods. The first uses only compressed sawdust and the second uses sawdust and paraffin, which is mixed and extruded into a log shape.<span></span></p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span> <span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>14</span><br>Spread the love<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxyfo6iqmahpGLAorLEZquoZZ2WuKZ50makqKqVqHqwuoyaZJ2topazra3MnmSlp5djtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
