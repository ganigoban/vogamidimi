Born in 1858, she has managed to leave a lasting impact on the entertainment world, showcasing her exceptional skills and abilities on screen.</p><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1858</span><p>She was born as <b>Ella Alexander</b> on July 26, 1858 in Van Wert, Ohio. Boole's father was a prominent <a href=#>Lawyer</a>, who edited a free soil newspaper and supported reforms during Reconstruction following the Civil War. She attended public schools in Van Wert, then the College of Wooster where she studied classics. She had an aptitude for natural science and developed skills in public speaking. She received an A.B. degree (1878), followed by an A.M. degree (1881).</p><span>1883</span><p>Boole's husband was active in prohibition and temperance activities, in which she joined him. Boole joined the Women's <a href=#>Christian</a> Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1883. She showed great skill as an organizer of new unions, and became vice-president of the New York state union in 1891. After the death of Boole's husband, she was able to support her family through an inheritance from her father and income from her speaking engagements and temperance activities. In 1898, she became <a href=#>President</a> of the New York WCTU. She held this position until 1925, with the exception of a six-year period when she was corresponding secretary of the Woman's Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church (1903-1909). One of her key activities was in shifting WCTU work away from its emphasis on collecting petitions, and towards direct lobbying of legislators.</p><span>1920</span><p>Following the enfranchisement of women in the United States, Boole decided to run for office herself. In 1920, she unsuccessfully challenged James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. for the Republican Party nomination for the United States Senate. After losing the nomination, she ran as a candidate for the Prohibition Party against Wadsworth and the Democratic and Socialist Party candidates in the general election. Wadsworth won easily with 52% of the vote, while Boole came in third place with 7% of the vote, not far ahead of the Socialist candidate.</p><span>1952</span><p>Boole served as head of the national Woman's <a href=#>Christian</a> Temperance Union from 1931 to 1947. She died on March 13, 1952 at age 93.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Some Elle Alexander images</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/47/elle-alexander-0.jpg alt="Elle Alexander" title="Elle Alexander" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/47/elle-alexander-1.jpg alt="Elle Alexander" title="Elle Alexander" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/47/elle-alexander-2.jpg alt="Elle Alexander" title="Elle Alexander" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/47/elle-alexander-3.jpg alt="Elle Alexander" title="Elle Alexander" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1858 births</a> <a href=#>1952 deaths</a> <a href=#>Women in New York (state) politics</a> <a href=#>New York (state) Prohibitionists</a> <a href=#>People from Van Wert County, Ohio</a> <a href=#>College of Wooster alumni</a> <a href=#>New York (state) Republicans</a> <a href=#>Social reformers</a> <a href=#>Activists from Ohio</a> <a href=#>Progressive Era in the United States</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeVobmmecClnLGZnpmys3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5lXFvcm8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
