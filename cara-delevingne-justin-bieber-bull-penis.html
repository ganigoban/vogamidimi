Cara Delevingne tried to teach Justin Bieber this invaluable lesson after he participated in James Corden's Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts segment on The Late Late Show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Faced with the option of either devouring the bull delicacy or ranking the supermodel friends of his wife, Hailey Bieber, from his "favorite to least favorite," Bieber made the mistake of ranking. In order, he placed Kendall Jenner as his favorite, followed by Hadid, then Delevingne.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He defended his choice, saying, "I know Kendall the best. I spent the most time with Kendall. She's a good friend of ours. I haven’t spent a lot of time with Gigi and I haven’t spent a lot of time with Cara, so I have nothing against those people."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You can watch the moment below starting around the 6:45 mark.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He might not have anything against Delevingne, but she definitely has something against him now. In an Instagram post that has since been deleted, the model responded, "If you have nothing against me, why don't you unblock me? Love you @haileybieber—he should have just eaten the bull penis."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To really bring the point home, she added a screenshot of Bieber on The Late Late Show and a picture of her walking down a runway while the singer gapes at her in the background. "Now vs. Then," she wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Delevingne's girlfriend, Ashley Benson, supported the blast by promptly liking the post and commenting with laughing emojis, reports <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a31042253/cara-delevingne-instagram-justin-bieber-feud/?utm_source=twitter&src=socialflowTW&utm_medium=social-media&utm_campaign=socialflowTWMAR" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marie Claire" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Marie Claire</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This isn't the first time Delevingne and Bieber have clashed. Last July, the singer wrote an apology to Taylor Swift for a "distasteful and insensitive" post he made in which he defended record executive Scooter Braun, whom Swift has <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29810854/celebrities-support-taylor-swift-amas/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="publicly battled for the rights of her music" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">publicly battled for the rights of her music</a>. Wife Hailey lauded his apology, calling him a "gentleman."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Delevingne pushed back against Bieber's so-called apology, calling out the couple. “Gentleman? @haileybieber @justinbieber you must be bored,” she wrote in the comments. "I wish you spent less time sticking up for men and more time trying to understand women and respecting their valid reactions. As a married man, you should be lifting women up instead of tearing them down because you are threatened. I am not sure you actually understand what an apology is. This issue that @taylorswift is talking out is about far more than a picture and you know that. As you said, you haven’t spoken to her in years which means you definitely don’t understand the situation. I do. Take a step back and try to learn from this. We should all be on the same team. End of story.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The ball (or should I say the bull?) is in your court now, Biebz.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
