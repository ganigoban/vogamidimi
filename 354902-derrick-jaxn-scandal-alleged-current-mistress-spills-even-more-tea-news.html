In his apology video, Jaxn claims that he's been faithful for months as he and his wife try to work on their marriage. Tasha K says that much is false, hosting his alleged current mistress, a successful doctor named Nicki, who says all of his recent social clips were filmed in front of her house, claiming that she saw him as recently as last week.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the latest expos√© by Tasha K, the blogger includes a phone call that she had with Derrick Jaxn's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">alleged mistress</a>, who says the relationship&nbsp;expert got her pregnant last year and tried influencing her not to terminate the pregnancy. Tasha also posted alleged screenshots of the text message conversation between Derrick and Nicki, in which Jaxn attempts to defuse the situation and tells his mistress that he'll show up to her workplace and will not leave until they talk.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This toxic mess is seemingly only getting started.
