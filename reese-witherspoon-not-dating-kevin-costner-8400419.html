Theories of a possible romance between the two were bubbling up online, but Witherspoon's representative issued a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a>, saying, "This story is completely fabricated and not true." Today's statement comes after a similar story that&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>connected Witherspoon with Tom Brady</a>&nbsp;back in April.
