It's understood to mean a tight, healthy relationship, but it pays no mind to how brothers actually are with each other, especially when they're young: Brothers fight, and brothers fight hard. It's almost as contentious a relationship as that of bandmates, and, as any episode of Behind the Music or a rock band biopic can tell you, band members seem to be at each other's throats more often than not, fighting over whose songs to do, artistic direction, and such. But when you mix a tricky and prickly <a href=#>brother dynamic</a> with band politics, it's remarkable anything gets done and recording sessions don't descend into a knock-down, drag-out wrestling match.&nbsp;</p><p>Drummer Jeff Porcaro co-founded Toto, and quickly asked his brother, keyboardist Steve Porcaro, to join in. After original bassist David Hungate <a href=#>left the group</a>&nbsp;in 1982, another one of those Porcaros, Mike, jumped from occasional <a href=#>Toto cellist</a> to full-time Toto bassist. That added up to a bubbling cauldron overflowing with searing hot animosity and resentment. "I felt undervalued," Steve Porcaro told Classic Rock (via <a href=#>Louder</a>) regarding his early years of Toto, adding, "Jeff and I were always at each other's throats. Mike got along with both of us. But Jeff and me really bumped heads." He recalled Jeff Porcaro getting frustrated if his sibling couldn't reach his perfectionist standards, but "there was definitely some brother s*** going down, because I'd hear him singing my praises when I wasn't around." (Which begs the questions: How did he hear things if he wasn't there? Was there a very different kind of bugging his brother going on?)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9lWxpb2lfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dqby1u44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
