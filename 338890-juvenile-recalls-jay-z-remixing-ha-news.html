Off the top, Vlad notes how "Ha" was an absolute game-changer. "You ain't lyin," notes Juve. "But the record that really started to make my album take off with record sales, and you probably wouldn't believe it, was 'Follow Me Now.' 'Ha' came out, that was the first release. The album sales weren't doing too great when 'Ha' came out."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/40/26/552640_086ec0ec555e17c32dea2b7f0eb8a894.jpg><p><h6>Prince Williams/Wireimage/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite the lackluster album sales, JAY-Z had been working on the remix on his own volition. "So when JAY-Z sent the remix to us, it&nbsp;was kind of unexpected. We didn't know he was going to do that anyway. He did it on his own. So the idea came to go back and put the JAY-Z song on the remix. Cause JAY-Z wasn't&nbsp;on the album originally. We gon' put the JAY-Z song on the album, and I recorded 'Follow Me Now' -- not knowing that it was a Carlos Santana sample, and not knowing it was already big before I said anything on it. It blew up."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Eventually, the team realized that the project's future ultimately centered around "Back That Azz Up," which was already gaining steam in the clubs.
