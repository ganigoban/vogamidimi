What I hope to cultivate with our family is that his kids have a new ally in me and my kids have a new ally in him, someone who really loves and cares about them but can have a different perspective and help me see things that I can't see with my kids because I'm so emotionally tied up."&nbsp;</p><p id=eUE3uLUEQA data-wc=39>The singer also fondly credited how strong her children are growing up to be, saying: "This generation is beautifully aware and involved and brave… I want my kids to stand up for themselves and the things they care about."</p><p id=eSlV9ssdR6 data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
