In the interview, Stevens acknowledged that they "<a href=#>had no business being in court</a>" and admitted that the children had been "embellishing and embellishing" their allegations.&nbsp;According to <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, Stevens admitted that they were aware that "the evidence was so bad and so weak" but they decided to push ahead with the case anyway. He even acknowledged the leading nature of the questions asked of the children, stating, "They were all contaminated."</p><p>During this time, defense attorneys were also repeatedly asserting that the prosecution was withholding information about Judy Johnson's mental health. The videotape of Stevens' interview confirmed the prosecution's role in actively withholding this information, in addition to various other exculpatory evidence.</p><p>In light of the tape, defense attorneys tried to get the charges against Ray and Peggy Buckey dropped, but the motion was denied by Judge Pounders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BmGtncGlfqbWmecKrmLOxXam%2FtrGMrKuoqqlivKd506GcZqWfqMFusdepnKermauybsDRopilZZmjeqK5xKugnJmeYrWqv9OoqbJn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
