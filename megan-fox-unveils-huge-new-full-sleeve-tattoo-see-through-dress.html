data-wc=19>It wasn't just the ink that grabbed attention, but her tiny chainmail dress that left little to the imagination.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMYfnYnFe6 data-wc=20>Of course, she looked beautiful in the bold outfit, which boasted a plunging neckline, mini length, and scattered silver discs.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_vt60wfw7 data-wc=25>To protect her modesty, she wore a flesh-colored thong and pasties over her chest, accessorizing with an oversized lip ring and stunning Simon G jewelry.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

ink but admitted that it didn't turn out how she hoped.<strong>&nbsp;"I just got one that I don't like that I have to rework,"</strong> she said on while promoting her poetry book,</p><p

It's not words you want associated with your body ever."&nbsp;</p><p id=e2OEsB8pPft data-wc=27>She didn't reveal the tattoo in question and has kept it under wraps until now, meaning she is finally happy to show off her latest body art.&nbsp;</p><p id=edYW00ZeYY data-wc=31>Her most recent inking isn't the first she's been unhappy with either.
