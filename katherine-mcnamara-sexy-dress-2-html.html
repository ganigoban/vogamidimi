And&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">playing strong characters</a>&nbsp;is precisely what she does with her characters in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrow</a>,&nbsp;Walker: Independence, and&nbsp;<a href=#>The Maze Runner</a>, but as you can see from the most recent post on her Instagram, that doesn’t keep her from embracing her feminine energy.&nbsp;</p><p>The post contains two images of the Arrow actress posing in a long peach dress with a tall slit and a strapless corset top. The first image sees her posing in a kneeling position, while the second is a more candid shot of her sitting on a stool and laughing as the photographer catches her in a moment of joy. Her caption is a fitting french phrase meaning the jovial enjoyment of life.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Katherine McNamara wouldn’t post something without calling out those who made the shoot possible. Involved in getting her look together are a celebrity stylist, Jordan Gross, make-up artist Kendal Fedail, hair stylist Maddie Torres, and the magic behind the camera, Shintani. The team came together to bring a gorgeous shot, of course, with a canvas like Katherine McNamara; anyone could be an artist.&nbsp;</p><p>Jordan Gross is a George Washington University educated and Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising trained stylist located in Los Angeles. She previously worked with massive names such as <a href=#>Karen Gillan</a> (Dr. Who&nbsp;and&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy) for Foxes, <a href=#>Alison Brie</a> (Glow&nbsp;and&nbsp;Community), and Karen Fukuhara (Bullet Train&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Boys). The shoot in the peach dress isn’t the first time she worked with Katherine McNamara, as she is a part of her extensive portfolio on her website.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kathleen-mcnamary-walker.jpg><p>Kendal Fedail is a Los Angeles-based make-up artist trained at the Make-Up Designory in California; she also supplements her time working for celebrities by working as a make-up artist at Nordstrom (according to her LinkedIn). She has worked with Madison Bailey (Outer Banks&nbsp;and&nbsp;Black Lightning), Emma Kenney (Shameless&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Connors), and Nicola Peltz Beckham (Transformers: Age of Extinction&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Last Airbender).&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie Torres has worked with Katherine McNamara before, as she pops up earlier on her Instagram, but spends the majority of her time as a stylist studying under LA salon owner Andy LeCompte. She has also worked with <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>. Shintani is a multifaceted LA-based artist with an extensive photography portfolio and the perfect fit for someone like Kat.&nbsp;</p><p>Katherine McNamara is most well known for her roles as the daughter of Oliver Queen and Felicity Smoke on&nbsp;Arrow, Clary Fray on&nbsp;Shadowhunters, and her most recent role as Abby Walker in the&nbsp;Walker: Texas Ranger&nbsp;prequel,&nbsp;Walker: Independence. But her ability to capture the attention of anyone lucky enough to lay their eyes on her modeling endeavors shows that she is much more than a talented actress. The camera loves her nearly as much as the fans watching her.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnm5bBqbHRoqWeZZ2Yu6K5wKuYZquVrcZusNGeqqxlYmO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
