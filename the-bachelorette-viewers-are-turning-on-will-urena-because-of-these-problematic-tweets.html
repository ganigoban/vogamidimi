What do you get out of it?” One tweet reads. “Ain’t no man with an alpha personality is attracted to an ‘alpha female.’”</p><p>In another tweet, he denounced the concept of toxic masculinity.</p><p>He wrote, “Toxic masculinity is a term coined by damaged women to weed out traits that make their fragile ego feel insecure when they’re in the shadow of a Male figure. A woman who had a strong & responsible father recognizes the importance of masculinity. It’s protective not oppressive.”</p><p>Another tweet specifically targeted American women.</p><p>“American women (in general) make it hard for a man to take them serious,” the tweet reads. “From the feminism bs, lack of accountability, wanting to be thots & increase masculine energy (to name a few)…I see why men are opting just to get a woman from a different country.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Bachelorette viewers call Will Urena out</h2><p>Users on the Reddit thread called Will’s tweets out for being misogynistic.</p><p>One user simply wrote, “YIKES.”</p><p>Others had specific criticisms of each of his problematic retweets.</p><p>One responded to the “alpha female” tweet by writing, “And this coming from a man who cried over a jacket.”</p><p>Another user thought the cringe-factor of his tweets went “over the top” when it said “just get a woman from a different country.”</p><p>Yet another viewer noted that it isn’t a woman’s fault if her father is or isn’t present in her life and she shouldn’t be judged for that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/will-urena-reddit-thread.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reality Steve called out Will Urena’s ‘problematic retweets’</h2><p>Monsters & Critics previously reported <a href=#>on</a> <a href=#>Will’s tweets</a> a few months before The Bachelorette aired.</p><p>Reality Steve issued a tweet to raise awareness about Will’s “problematic retweets” in July.</p><p>“Will Urena, 29, Domican Republic. IG: (@illmaticwill). Fitness trainer. But holy s**t, some recent problematic retweets,” Reality Steve tweeted, as captured by the Redditor. “Apparently he doesn’t like US women. It’s the Alpha Male-ness for me. Good chance this will kill his chances of making it on the show. Yikes.”</p><p>Ironically, as viewers now know, Will was not cut from the show. In fact, he has played a key role in one of the storylines due to his rivalry with Peter Izzo.</p><p>Peter got a villain edit as<a href=#> he threw Will’s jacket in the pool</a>. Many admired Will for taking the high road and not tattling on him to Michelle.</p><p>However, now that these tweets have come to Bachelor Nation’s attention, it seems that many are changing sides or acknowledging that both Peter and Will are flawed.</p><p>The Bachelorette airs on Tuesdays at 8/7c on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6Sdsm6uwJyfnqSfp7K1wMRmraKdp5q%2FtHnAq5xmrKWnu6q6xmamp2WnnrmtedSrnKeZXZeypK3UrJxmp5Ziwamx0p5kqaqfl7mmucCtoJxlpKyypsDSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
