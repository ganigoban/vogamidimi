He originally hails from Washington, USA, but he spent his formative years growing up in Charlotte, North Carolina. Later, he pursued his education in Alabama and even embarked on a journey to New Zealand before finally settling in Charleston. Austen’s entrepreneurial spirit led him to create his very own beer called Trop Hop, brewed by his company, Kings Calling Brewing Company, back in 201His former flame, Madison LeCroy, is three years younger than him, currently aged 3In comparison, Lindsay Hubbard is 35, while Ciara Miller is the youngest among them at just 25.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Austen Kroll’s Towering Height</strong></h3><p>Austen Kroll stands tall at an impressive height of 6 feet 5 inches. Many fans have wondered why he’s such a magnet for women, and it seems like his towering height might be the answer. Paige DeSorbo, who happens to be Craig Conover’s new girlfriend, also shares this sentiment. She recently appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen and had this to say: “Well, he is 6’5″, so I will attest to that. He’s a large man. And he is fun. He’s really fun to, like, go out with. He has a charm about him.” Austen often stands head and shoulders above his fellow cast members, making him quite the presence on screen.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>&nbsp;Ciara and Lindsay’s Heights</strong></h3><p>When it comes to comparing heights with Austen, Ciara Miller and Lindsay Hubbard have their own unique statures. Ciara measures up at 5 feet 8 inches, which means she won’t have to worry about towering over Austen, even if she decides to wear heels. On the other hand, Lindsay Hubbard is quite petite, standing at just 5 feet 3 inches. This significant height difference might explain why Austen could easily lift her up for a warm hug. Realistically, Ciara may seem like a better physical match for Austen, although there’s almost a ten-year age gap between them. However, as they say, age is just a number, and for Austen, the size of a woman might not matter much.</p><h3><strong>My Final Opinion,</strong></h3><p>Winter House viewers have had their curiosity satisfied regarding Austen Kroll’s age and towering height. At 6 feet 5 inches, Austen’s height undoubtedly adds to his appeal, making him a larger-than-life presence both on and off the screen. While Ciara’s height might make her a more natural fit for Austen in terms of stature, the real question of compatibility goes beyond just physical dimensions. As the Winter House drama unfolds, viewers will surely be keeping a close eye on Austen’s romantic entanglements with Ciara and Lindsay, regardless of any differences in age or height.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxxhY6woKeslad6qbvUrJxmr5iWwW610maYrqukmrtut9Goo6WrXZ2yqrPHrWSappRirqixjaGrpqQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
