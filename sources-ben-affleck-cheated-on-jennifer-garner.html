And according to Us Weekly, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ben-affleck-was-seeing-lindsay-shookus-during-jen-garner-marriage-w491401 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Affleck and Shookus allegedly had an affair" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Affleck and Shookus allegedly had an affair</a> while they were both still married to other people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Us Weekly's sources, "Ben and Lindsay started their affair about three years ago, just a few months after she became a mom."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Affleck and ex-wife Jennifer Garner announced their separation in June 2015, right after their ten year wedding anniversary. So Us Weekly's report suggests that Affleck allegedly <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/celebrity/ben-affleck-lindsay-shookus-romance-began-while-he-was-married-to-jennifer-garner/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="started a relationship with Shookus" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">started a relationship with Shookus</a>, a producer at Saturday Night Live, before he broke up with Garner. A source over at People also alleges that Affleck and Shookus "didnâ€™t hide. They would use the Mandarin Oriental. They were regulars."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, it's important to stress that these are just rumors, according to "sources", and that the reports are far from confirmed. Especially as Us Weekly also report that another source told them, "Lindsay was not what led to the end of their marriage."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" title="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Amy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.
