"Abby would say, 'She can't wear a bow tomorrow,' and I'd be like, 'Abby, you can't tell us what to wear,'" Jessalynn told TIME about stirring the spot. "Then I would come home, and I would be like, 'JoJo, Abby doesn't want you to wear a bow tomorrow,' and she'd go, 'That's it. I'm wearing a bigger bow.'"</p><p>Despite the drama, Miller liked JoJo immediately. "She has that certain je ne sais quoi, and she's shining bright," she <a href=#>said</a> during a Dance Moms episode about JoJo's introduction to the group. This created tension among the girls, as&nbsp;<a href=#>Mackenzie Ziegler</a> and&nbsp;Kalani Hilliker didn't seem to appreciate her presence. "I think JoJo is crazy and nuts, and she talks a lot," Kalani complained.</p><p>JoJo ended up securing a spot on the&nbsp;ALDC dance team but left the show after Season 6 to pursue her career with Nickelodeon. The rest is history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2ljboV5e9ahmK1lmqS3sHnSoq6aZaeWwG64yKScZpqVm7yzsYytn55llpa6pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
