Nevertheless, she's alive and well, and highly successful in the music industry and film production, both in front of and behind the camera. One of her most well-known roles came in 2017, when she starred in the most current movie adaptation of the Agatha Christie classic, "Murder on the Orient Express."</p><p>Although Katherine Wilder would maintain her adopted surname, she never again spoke to her stepfather, something that bothered the comedian and actor until the day he died. In 2005, he released the memoir "Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art," in part to address these difficult periods in his life. Although he doubted Katherine would ever read the book, he said he wrote it to remind her of "things I did lovingly, for her. Do I think she'll read it? No. But if she does, I hope it will explain some things she didn't want to understand" (per <a href=#>Bustle)</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkG9raXFfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSgnZ6aeri1y52cq6tdma62s8etnKtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
