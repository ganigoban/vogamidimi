She vented about the twins' behavior, calling out their mother for bringing them on the plane in the first place. Zonnique Pullins responded to her posts, revealing that the children in question were hers. She responded to the rapper's comments, telling her, "You should [have] just sat there and been mad babe..she sky priority af," adding a cheeky emoji.</p><p>Chika went off on the mother in her recent Twitter rant.

She went on to claim that at the time of her posts she hadn't slept in two days, and was having "really bad thoughts." She then cited "double-standards," claiming that despite throwing anything her way, haters are quick to be on her case. "We all go through it we all say things," Chika claimed.
