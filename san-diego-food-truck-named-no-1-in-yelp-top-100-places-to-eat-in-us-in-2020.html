The list is then curated “with the expertise of our community managers around the country to finalize the rankings,” a Yelp spokesperson told NBC 7.</p><p>“The result is a list as quirky, interesting and unique as the Yelp community itself – from white tablecloth restaurants to food trucks and gyro shops,” the spokesperson added.</p><p><a href=#>Shawarma Guys</a> is among three San Diego-area spots that landed on this year’s Top 100 list. The other two are <a href=#>Soichi Sushi</a> – a sushi bar on Adams Avenue that cracked the top 10, landing at No. 9 – and <a href=#>Mr. Bibi,</a> a Korean restaurant on North Coast Highway in Oceanside, which snagged the No. 26 spot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-nbc-section-heading>Shawarma Guys</h2><p>Parked in an empty lot near at 3012 Grape Street in South Park (near the Bottle House and east of Grape Street Dog Park) the Shawarma Guys specializes in authentic Mediterranean cuisine which, as the small business’ website proudly proclaims is “made with love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/Shawarma-Guys-Truck-Yelp-NellE.jpg><p>The business is owned by Bryan Zeto and has only been there for about a year. Zeto told NBC 7 Tuesday that in his short time in South Park, the community has been incredibly supportive. In return, he works to patrons the best of the Shawarma Guys.</p><p>"We try to give everybody good customer service, like if you were to go to a fine dining restaurant -- without the fine dining, obviously," he explained.</p><p>Items on the menu range from $3 to $15 and include hummus, tabouli, Greek salad, and, of course – shawarma, including Wagyu Beef Shawarma and Chicken Shawarma. Yelpers rave about the pita and <a href=#>fresh falafels</a> and many reviews tout the dishes as warm, tasty “comfort food.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Shawarma Guys is open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; it’s currently closed on Sundays but Zeto told NBC 7 he plans on opening the truck on Sundays starting Feb. 8.</p><p>There are a couple of tables set up in front of the food truck where, if you're lucky enough to snag a seat, you can relax and enjoy your food.</p><p>On Tuesday, the food truck was buzzing with patrons, many of whom visited for lunch after hearing about the eatery's prestigious Yelp ranking.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Zeto told NBC 7 he hopes to one day open a brick-and-mortar Shawarma Guys restaurant, but even if that happens, he still plans to keep the food truck that started it all up and running at its little spot on Grape Street.</p><p>By the way, the Shawarma Guys food truck is no stranger to accolades. Redbook and Yelp once named it the best food truck in California.</p><h2 class=wp-block-nbc-section-heading>Soichi Sushi (No. 9)</h2><p>Located at 2121 Adam Ave., <a href=#>Soichi Sushi</a> specializes in authentic Japanese Omakase dining, artistically prepared and presented, course by course.</p><p>An Omakase experience includes eight courses personally selected by the restaurant’s namesake Chef Soichi himself, including sashimi, Nigiri sushi and Shirumono, a Japanese-style fish soup. This experience starts at $125 per person. Patrons can also order items a la carte – including tempura and oysters – ranging from $8 to $14. Yelpers say the fresh ingredients, friendly staff and authenticity of Soichi Sushi is what keeps them coming back for more.</p><p>Soichi Sushi is open from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and is closed on Sundays. The restaurant is currently closed for a holiday break, but is set to reopen Jan. 15.</p><h2 class=wp-block-nbc-section-heading>Mr. Bibi</h2><p>Up in San Diego’s North County, at 208 North Coast Highway, is the Korean hot spot, Mr. Bibi.</p><p>The menu here features make-your-own bowls, plus soups, salads and appetizers like pan-fried gyoza and all kinds of tempura options.
