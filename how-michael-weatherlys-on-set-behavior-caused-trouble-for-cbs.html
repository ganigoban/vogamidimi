But "Bull" was also a headache for the network. In 2018, <a href=#>The New York Times</a> reported that CBS agreed to a confidential settlement with <a href=#>"Bull" actor Eliza Dushku</a>, paying her $9.5 million. The settlement was the amount the network determined Dushku would have earned if she was a cast member on "Bull" for four seasons. Dushku claimed that once producers decided her character would be the on-screen love interest of the titular Jason Bull, Weatherly "remarked on her appearance and made a rape joke and a comment about a threesome." The Times reported that after Dushku confronted Weatherly about his behavior, she was fired from the series.</p><p>Weatherly addressed the situation with Dushku in a statement: "When Eliza told me that she wasn't comfortable with my language and attempt at humor, I was mortified to have offended her and immediately apologized. After reflecting on this further, I better understand that what I said was both not funny and not appropriate. I am sorry and regret the pain this caused Eliza." In 2021, <a href=#>Deadline</a> reported Dushku testified before the House Judiciary Committee about her experience being "fired in silence" from "Bull," and urged Congress to pass laws to protect more women against sexual harassment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG9laX53e8eormalmZi1orHLZq6emaSdsrO42KxkqKZdqLK1ecGen5qumaS%2Fbq%2FArqqenF2pv7DBwaWcZp6fp3qkrtJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
