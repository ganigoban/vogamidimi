After he was cut from the varsity team in his first two years of high school, Cole went on to become a starter in his senior year. He had faith that he could play at the Division 1 level of college basketball but ultimately, attended St. John's University on an academic scholarship. There, J Cole tried out for the university's basketball team as a walk-on and made it to the final ten out of 70-80 players. According to Cole, he was not cut by the team but instead, elected not to play because he believed he wasn't ready for the commitment or lifestyle. Despite this, J. Cole frequently practiced with St. John's women's team and played intramural basketball.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beginning-of-professional-career>Beginning of Professional Career</h2></span><p>KIGALI, RWANDA - MAY 16: Jermaine Cole #15 of the Patriots Basketball Club is congratulated by teammate Brandon Costner #33 during the second half against the Rivers Hoopers Basketball Club at Kigali Arena on May 16, 2021 in Kigali, Rwanda.

Cole shared an article with The Player's Tribune that detailed his desire to play in the NBA after he graduated from college. In the article, he stated, "If I can blow up in the next three years, that means I'll only be 27. That still might give me enough time to train and pursue a professional basketball career. I'll work hard enough to go play overseas and then try to work my way to the NBA." A few weeks after The Player's Tribune article, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Master P</a> confirmed J. Cole was training for the NBA.</p><p>Though he didn't make it to the big leagues, in 2021, J. Cole signed a contract with <a href=# rel>Rwanda-based Patriots Basketball Club</a> in the Basketball Africa League. Finally, Cole found himself one step closer to the NBA.

Cole proved he could play basketball on a professional level. Along with this, his professional career continued in Canada.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scarborough-shooting-stars-stint>Scarborough Shooting Stars Stint</h2></span><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/Cekd_C9lJjK/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading</p></figure><p>On May 19, 2022, J.

On June 2022, Cole confirmed he was taking an indefinite leave of absence to go on tour.</p><p>In regards to his time with the team, Cole said, "Man, it's&nbsp;been phenomenal. I was telling the guys in there like, 'I'm going for these shows, I'm not sure if I'll be back.' But just in case, I had to let them know how incredible this was. The players, the coaching staff, the organization, the league, it's a crazy thing when you see it on paper, when you see whatâ€™s actually happening, and they made me feel so welcome." J. Cole did not confirm if he would be back in the interview.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-future-of-j-cole-s-basketball-career>The <a href=# class=text-word>Future</a> of J.
