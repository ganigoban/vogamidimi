Between their reality show and constant back-and-forths on social media, the two have the world tuning into their frequent bickering. Most recently, Blueface took issue with Chrisean Rock’s role in <a href=# class=text-word rel>DDG</a> and Rubi Rose’s feud. Rock and Rose linked up shortly after Rubi l<a href=# rel>eaked a DM from the “Moonwalking In Calabasas” rappe</a>r. That’s when Rock <a href=# rel>revealed that she encouraged Rose to stir the pot.</a></p><p>Rock’s actions infuriated Blueface, who blasted his partner online in a series of tweets. Blueface and DDG formed a strong relationship over the past few years and even went on a double date. At that time, it appeared that Blueface believed Halle and Rock also formed a bond. However, Chrisean’s recent actions suggested otherwise. “The homy beefing with his bitch cuz my bitch gave some boof advice to a fan of hers then ima hold court cuz that’s not player at all,” he wrote.&nbsp; DDG a good N***a I’m really mad for him cuz this weird bitch play cool with him an Halle I’m real life.”</p><span><h2 id=h-blueface-blasts-chrisean-rock-again>Blueface Blasts Chrisean Rock, Again</h2></span><p>Blueface reiterated these claims and expanded on them in a lengthy post shared on his Instagram Story. Without tagging Rock, he called out her “disloyalty” for gossiping about her friends’ business. “People talk down on they own friends and call it gossip. I call it disloyalty,” he wrote on Instagram. “The truth could never be a diss if you don’t take the initial correction in private an make an adjustment,” he added. He said that this type of behavior will leave someone in a “cold twist publicly every time.”</p><p>Though the two have been on the <a href=# rel>brink of break-u</a>p recently, Blueface suggested that he’s fed up with her behavior. “... You could have called me,” he wrote. “Everything in the dark come to the light ‘one day’ and it’s too late by then… you not a real friend for putting the truth out there… that’s boof the truth could never be disrespectful stand on it.” Chrisean Rock hasn't responded to Blueface’s latest comment. We’ll keep you posted on anymore updates surrounding their latest back-and-forth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaH9xfZVmmaWtlZuupLGMrJyepZmjtK3FjJyYpaSjYry2wIycn6uho5qur3nRqJqkq12ZtrS4zrKYpaypYq6utcNmm52fXafCo7WMq6asnV2bsraw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
