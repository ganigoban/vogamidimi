I keep all the ingredients in my pantry anyway. I may as well combine them myself instead of picking up an extra spice! More importantly, making my own Italian seasoning allows me to control the balance of flavors. My homemade blend has a mix of sweet, earthy, and aromatic notes that I absolutely love. I’ve shared my favorite Italian seasoning recipe below. Try it as written, or experiment with the ratios to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>As soon as I finish writing this post, I’m heading to the kitchen and making more of these zucchini brownies. It’s impossible for me to sit here, looking at photos of their glossy tops and gooey, chocolatey middles and NOT start to crave them. Tell me they’re tempting you too? The really fun thing about this zucchini brownies recipe is that even though is has 2 WHOLE CUPS of zucchini inside it, the zucchini is almost undetectable. It melts into the rich chocolate batter, giving the brownies an amazing moist and gooey texture. I’ll admit that they’re slightly cakier than…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Ok, saucy, cheesy comfort food fans – you’re going to love this eggplant rollatini recipe! “Rollatini” is an Americanized version of the Italian word “involtini,” which describes small bundles of food made by rolling thin slices of meat or produce around a filling. In this eggplant rollatini recipe, I wrap delicate planks of roasted eggplant around a rich blend of lemon zest, pecorino, and ricotta cheese. I nestle the rolls in a dish of marinara sauce and bake until the filling is hot and the eggplant is tender. The combination of flavors and textures is fantastic. The filling offers a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There are so many reasons to love this summer tomato galette, but one of the biggest is that it will make your kitchen smell amazing. I mean, it’s not surprising. Roasted tomatoes create a pretty tempting aroma on their own. Add buttery pastry to the mix, and OF COURSE you’re going to be glued to the oven door, anxiously waiting for the minute you can take this tomato galette out of the oven and taste your first slice. Speaking of the oven… I know it might seem crazy to crank it up to 400°F and bake a galette – of…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you ask me, a mezze platter is the perfect solution for feeding a crowd. This Middle Eastern tradition of serving a medley of appetizers and small plates before a meal (or even as a meal) ensures that there’s always something for everyone. Folks can munch on fresh veggies, salads, bread, cheese, dips, spreads, and more. I love that you can prep every component ahead of time, so if you’re entertaining, you just have to pull the dishes out of the fridge and assemble your mezze platter when your guests are ready to eat. They’ll love sampling all the different…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Herbs are arguably my favorite fresh ingredients, so it should come as no surprise that I love tabbouleh. Alternatively spelled tabouli or tabouleh, this Middle Eastern salad consists of finely chopped parsley, mint, tomatoes, and bulgur wheat. Don’t let the bulgur’s presence fool you – traditional Lebanese tabbouleh isn’t so much a grain salad as it is an herb salad with&nbsp;grains. The parsley and mint are the real star ingredients, making the salad pungent, fragrant, and intensely refreshing. You’ll find my go-to tabbouleh recipe below. If you love bright, herbaceous flavors, it’s one you have to try. Pack it up…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love serving this creamy whipped feta dip at parties and gatherings because it always surprises people. It looks like any other creamy white dip, maybe a ranch-y sort of thing made with cream cheese or sour cream. But it tastes like something else entirely. Lemon gives it zing, garlic adds bite, and the feta fills it with a delicious salty tang. Set it out with pita and veggies, and I promise, it’ll disappear in minutes. Another reason I love this whipped feta dip recipe? It’s SO easy to make. You just need 5 ingredients, 5 minutes, and a food…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This recipe is my take on muhammara, the Middle Eastern red pepper and walnut dip. I love to make it in the summer, when peppers are abundant and a cool dip sounds like the perfect starting point for a meal or snack. In case you’re not familiar with muhammara, here’s a little background: this punchy dip originated in Syria, and it’s now common throughout the Middle East. Its key ingredients are roasted red peppers, walnuts, breadcrumbs, chile flakes, and pomegranate molasses, which combine to make it thick, nutty, zingy, spicy, sour, and sweet. I still remember the first time I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This roasted eggplant recipe is so tasty that you might find yourself devouring it straight off the baking sheet. Yes, eggplant skeptics – even you. The thing about cooking eggplant is that it’s easy to get wrong. Underdo it, and it’s spongy and tough. Overdo it, and it turns to mush. But get it just right, and eggplant is one of the most flavorful vegetables out there. This roasted eggplant recipe is a super simple way to get eggplant right. It comes out of the oven beautifully caramelized and golden brown around the edges and melt-in-your-mouth tender in the middle.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>On Sunday, I wrote all about how Jack and I love grilling halloumi in the summer. I thought I’d follow up that post with an example of how we like to serve the halloumi once it comes off the grill: in these delicious bowls! This recipe is my kind of summer meal – one that’s fresh and flavorful but still plenty satisfying. It starts with a base of fragrant coconut rice and black beans. Then, I pile on the grilled halloumi, a scoop of peach salsa, and creamy avocado slices. A handful of fresh mint leaves and drizzles of cilantro…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If panzanella is my favorite summer dinner, then grilled halloumi cheese is unquestionably Jack’s. He doesn’t care how I serve it: in a summery grain bowl, in sandwiches, or just plated up with sliced tomatoes and a side of crusty bread. He loves its charred, salty flavor and rich, squeaky texture. I can’t blame him – I’m a big fan of it too! What is halloumi cheese? If you’re thinking, “Wait,&nbsp;cheese&nbsp;on the&nbsp;grill??”, I get it! A slice of cheddar or mozzarella would melt right through the grates. But not halloumi. This cheese, which hails from Cyprus, has a uniquely firm…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVflsK1tM6rZqOdkaO2r7GOqZignV9ngXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
