She’s literally begging her to stop”) that she left on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>resurfaced 2012 segment</a> where Swift became visibly uncomfortable when asked to ring a bell each time a photo of a man she dated appeared on the screen.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I recently became a Swiftie. I loved her last album and I’ve seen her documentary, but I wasn’t following her career in the same way the last 10-plus years,” Ratajkowski shared. “Watching that [interview], I was so struck by how clear she’s being about what is making her uncomfortable.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The model added, “I think the lens that I would’ve viewed that interview from 10 years ago versus now has evolved so much, which is why it struck me. I was in bed falling asleep and commented on it, not because I thought it was going to make headlines at all.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">EmRata then touched on how Swift’s relationship with media and the internet has closely resembled her own in many ways: “She’s another example of a woman who has been faced with such blatant misogyny and sexism, and yet we don’t want to admit that, because she’s powerful and successful, and also she’s white,” she said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The multi-hyphenate continued, “There’s a bunch of reasons, which I think are fair and important to also bring up in the conversation, but that clip in particular was just so striking to me because she was communicating very clearly about why she didn’t feel comfortable with what was happening. And it was making everyone laugh. It actually upset me. And I think that just even that speaks to a larger thing I’ve noticed, where people don’t listen to femme-presenting people.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ratajkowski’s supportive comments come shortly after she was spotted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>getting cozy with Swift’s ex, Harry Styles</a>, during in outing in Tokyo — but there’s no need to worry about any “Bad Blood.” Styles and Swift have remained friendly since their 2013 breakup, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>reuniting as recently as during the 2023 Grammys</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xKagpbFdp661rcmkprCrm556tK3InWSsoJWoeqJ50rCgn6yZmnqmuMueZHBrZ2d%2Bdn8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
