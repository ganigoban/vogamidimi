He plays The Darkling, aka General Kirigan, the direct foil to Jessie Mei Li's protagonist, Alina Starkov. Barnes is no stranger to the young adult genre, having starred as Prince Caspian in "The Chronicles of Narnia" series, though he's also had practice playing a darker character in "Westworld."</p><p dir=ltr>Throughout his time in the spotlight, Barnes has been attached to a few different starlets, though he's been notoriously private about his life off-screen. Per <a href=#>Distractify</a>, he's been attached to actor Tamsin Egerton from 2009-2010, though she's been with Josh Harnett since 2013. He then reportedly dated actor Meganne Young, as seen in posts on her Instagram page, though it seems the two of them have broken up. Young may be recognized for her work on "Black Sails," "Supernatural," and Netflix's "The Kissing Booth 2."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Barnes has since stepped out with former "Dancing with the Stars" pro dancer and judge Julianne Hough. The two were <a href=#>spotted grabbing ice cream together</a>, reported <a href=#>People</a>, though a source told the publication they "have been friends for eight years" and aren't dating. Barnes has been seen with Hough before, as well. They were photographed taking a walk together in April 2020 and attended HBO's Emmys party together in 2016. The dancer has recently divorced her husband, so Barnes may just be supporting his friend as she's going through a tough time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHFkbIR2e9OhnGaqlZa5brjIn5xmqJGnwa%2Bx0axkqJ5dqbWmecKaqq1ln5t6tLTAnaawZZGjsW6uzqecaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
