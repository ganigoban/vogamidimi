As the interview began, she appeared visibly emotional. “I didn’t expect that I would feel tearful, but it has been an absolutely, tremendously moving two in a half or three weeks,” she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the interview, Judd details what she calls Weinstein’s sexual harassment, which happened during a meeting in a hotel room. She claims he asked to give her a massage, then asked for her to give him one, and she kept declining. According to her account, he steered her toward a closet, then asked her to watch him take a shower. She allegedly ended up saying she’d reconsider after she won an Oscar in one of his movies, and “fled.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Am I proud of that? I’m of two minds. The part that shames myself says no,” she told Sawyer. “The part of me that understands the way shame works says, ‘That was absolutely brilliant, good job kid, you got out of there, well done.’ It’s a very important word, shame, and it’s a very important thing to talk about. So we all do the best we can, and our best is good enough, and it’s really okay to have responded however we responded.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She said she told several people about the alleged encounter, but worried she wouldn’t be believed. And though Weinstein claimed the two were friends, and he even tried to set her up with his brother, she denied they were friends. “That’s deny, attack, reverse the order of offender and victim,” she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later on, she said, she was about to confront Weinstein at an event, and he apparently told her, “You know, Ashley, I’m going to let you out of that little agreement we made.” Judd said she replied, “You do that, Harvey. You do that.” After that moment, Judd claims, “he has spat my name at me every since.” After that, she made two movies with his studio, but says she doesn't recall him being a big presence while filming.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Judd, who also spoke about the problem of sexual harassment in other industries, had some parting words for Weinstein: though she'll never forgive him, she said she believes "there is hope and help for everyone" as long as they acknowledge what they did wrong. “What I'd say to Harvey is I love you, and I understand that you are sick and suffering, and there is help for a guy like you, too, and it's entirely up to you to get that help," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch parts of the Good Morning America segment below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaaWNlhnh9lXJmmquYobK6ecmum51llJ6ur7GMrJiwsZWneqq6056pr6GVrHqprdGvnLJlp5q2r7%2FTnqCnZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
