But California is full of fault lines, meaning it is especially prone to fault-related earthquakes. The area where the most recent earthquake occurred lies near the Cascadia subduction fault—where the United States sits right over the ocean floor—meaning this area is especially prone to earthquakes.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener class=multivariate>earthquake and subsequent aftershocks</a> should not trigger any eruptive activity, according to USGS Volcanoes.</p><p>"Only very very rarely do earthquakes trigger eruptive activity at a nearby volcano. Basically the volcano has to be about ready to erupt anyway for that to happen," the USGS said in a <a href=# data-sys=1 class=multivariate>Facebook</a> comment.</p><p>At the Clear Lake Volcanic Field, in California's northern Coast Ranges, two small earthquakes were reported, the largest being a magnitude of 1.2. At the Geyser located south of there, 118 earthquakes were recorded, the largest with a 2.7 magnitude.</p><figure class="block block-ibtg-article fA" data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action=Click></figure><p>A magnitude 1.8 earthquake also rattled Mammoth Mountain, in the Inyo National Forest, while a magnitude 2.3 earthquake shook Salton Buttes.</p><p>Other volcanoes monitored following the earthquake include Mount Shasta, Medicine Lake Volcano, Lassen Volcanic Center, Long Valley Volcanic Region, Coso Volcanic Field, and Ubehebe Craters.</p><p>The USGS said the earthquake and its aftershocks are showing up "beautifully" on its monitoring technology They are continuing to monitor helicorder records and spectrograms to asses how the shaking manifests across distances.</p><p>The earthquake reached Shasta and Lassen at nearly the same time, but with fewer high frequencies the farther it traveled, according to the USGS.</p><p>Meanwhile, it reached Long Valley a "few moments later with much of the high-frequency signal missing completely."</p><p>"This is a common phenomenon with earthquakes that travel long distances—for example, our stations might only register the very lowest-frequency signals from a large earthquake that happens in Japan or Chile," the USGS said.</p><span><i class=uncommon-logo></i></span><h2>Uncommon Knowledge</h2><p class=subtitle-desktop>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p class=subtitle-mobile>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p>");jQuery(this).remove()}) jQuery('.start-slider').owlCarousel({loop:!1,margin:10,nav:!0,items:1}).on('changed.owl.carousel',function(event){var currentItem=event.item.index;var totalItems=event.item.count;if(currentItem===0){jQuery('.owl-prev').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-prev').removeClass('disabled')} if(currentItem===totalItems-1){jQuery('.owl-next').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-next').removeClass('disabled')}})}})})</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrK6enZtjsLC5jpyYpaGWpL%2BvtcBmraikk5a7sLHSZqmarKShsqV5xJqpraChqq6ssYxqbm9xYm5%2B</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
