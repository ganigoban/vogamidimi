In fact, she doesn't want to be the next anyone.</p><p>In a since-deleted Instagram video posted in 2016, the singer-songwriter pleaded with everyone to stop comparing her to other artists. "I ain't tryin' to be Sia," she said (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>). "I ain't tryin' to be Melanie Martinez. I don't want to be Taylor Swift. I just want to be me, so please stop comparing." VanderWaal explained that the comparisons have bothered her for a long time, so she wanted to get it off her chest. "I just want to say something that's been bothering me for a while and it's that I just want to be grace!" she added. "Not Taylor Swift or Melanie or anyone else that I'm compared to! I'm so grateful and take it as a HUGE compliment but I'm just trying to be me."</p><p>She also wants to make it clear that she's not ungrateful. Speaking to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;in 2016, she said that it's been a "blessing" to be compared to superstars. "Honestly, a lot â€” all celebrities have flack and stuff around them, but what it all comes down to is that they're all amazing musicians that all write amazing songs," VanderWaal&nbsp;mused. "To even have someone think about comparing me to someone like that is just truly a blessing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmxjbX54e9ahsGafopawpnnVmqWdnaKsrqK4jJ2mnqueqXqttcqeZJudmaO0bq%2FOpqeaqpWZerW7jK2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
