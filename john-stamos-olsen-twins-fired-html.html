Stamos recently told a humorous story on Josh Peck (<a href=#>Drake & Josh</a>) and Ben Soffer’s <a href=#>Good Guys</a> podcast where he said he got the <a href=#>Olsen</a> twins fired because they wouldn’t stop crying while filming scenes. However, Stamos changed his tune when they replaced the twins with an apparently worse set of twins saying “I’m sure their parents loved them and thought they were attractive,” adding “It was only a few days, and I said, ‘Bring the Olsens back!”</p><p>At the beginning of Full House the Olsen twins were only 11 months old, so it’s not surprising that they weren’t exactly professionals at the time. While John Stamos’ reason was a bit harsh, it’s also understandable that constant crying might make it a bit difficult to film your scenes. Fortunately, everything worked out for the better, and the Olsen twins obviously didn’t cry as much in later seasons when they weren’t literal babies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mary-kate-ashley-olsen-michelle-tanner-full-house-900x506.jpg><p>Full House ended up launching the career of John Stamos, the late Bob Saget, the Olsen twins, and the rest of the main cast. Running for 193 episodes between 1987 and 1995, the classic sitcom is beloved to this day. New and old fans of the show alike still watch and discover the series on <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=streaming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>streaming</a> services regularly.</p><p>Since Full House ended, John Stamos has mostly stuck to TV roles in his long career. In recent years, he has taken on quite a few voice-acting projects. He even fulfilled a long-time fan casting role by voicing <a href=#>Tony Stark</a>/Iron Man in the animated Spidey and his Amazing Friends series.</p><p>John Stamos also recently had a voice role on the other side of the comic book aisle as Etrigan the Demon in HBO Max’s <a href=#>Harley Quinn</a>. Stamos also took on some other recent projects for Disney. He had both a voice role in Mickey Mouse Funhouse and a live-action role in the Disney+ series Big Shot.</p><p>However, the John Stamos-led Disney+ series Big Shot was unfortunately canceled after only two seasons amidst some other content cutbacks for the streaming platform. Although those who did watch the show enjoyed it, apparently it didn’t have the audience for <a href=#>Disney</a> to greenlight another season. The series followed a hot-headed NCAA basketball coach who is fired from his job and must take a coaching job at an all-girls private high school instead.</p><p>While John Stamos may have lost out on Big Shot, he quickly bounced back with a greenlit series called Open Book that will be coming to the Freevee platform. Open Book is inspired by Jessica Simpson’s memoir of the same name and stars Katlyn Tarver as Sadie Sparrow, a pop star who becomes a mogul. Stamos plays Butch Thorn, a former singer-songwriter with destructive tendencies who becomes attracted to Sadie before learning that she’s the pop star he’ll be writing songs for.</p><p>Open Book is written by Tom Kapinos who is also executive producing with Adam Berstein and Jessica Simpson. Bernstein is also on board to direct the pilot. There’s no word yet on when we can expect to see this John Stamos series on Freevee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iin527br%2FTmqSoq12kubSxzWarsKGeqHqntdGem2egpKK5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
