Entwistle and Moon were delighted to make the acquaintance of Johnson and took him out for a TV interview, drinks, and other chemical romances. One thing led to another — like the show starting without them. Daltrey and Townshend had recruited a drummer and bassist from one of the other bands on the bill. Entwistle and Moon arrived and were — unhappy. The angry bandmates took their usual spots half-way through. During the finale, Moon started trashing his drum kit and a cymbal flew out of control, smacking into Townshend's leg. Annoyed, Townshend swung his guitar, "not really meaning to hit Keith," but it slipped and did indeed hit Keith — in the head. And then things got really bloody. As the curtain came down, the emcee told the audience that it was all part of the show. Johnson referred to it as a "frenzy," calling it "the biggest fight I've ever seen. ... Guys were bleeding. The concert was one of the best things I'd ever seen, [but] I was thinking that maybe 'God Only Knows' was more fun to do."</p><p>Moon needed stitches. He and Entwistle announced they were leaving the band, but walked that back almost immediately, with Entwistle playing with them the next night, and Moon back on stage by May 28. Boys will be boys. Who knew?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkHFub2lfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZquhnV2stbC%2FjKilZquklrSmecGrmLCkXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
