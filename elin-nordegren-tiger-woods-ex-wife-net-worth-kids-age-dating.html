She comes from a family of five.&nbsp;Her mother’s name is Barbro Holmberg while her father’s name is Thomas Nordegren.&nbsp;Her mother is a politician and has served as governor and minister.&nbsp;Nordegren’s father, on the other hand, is a radio journalist.&nbsp;She also has a twin sister named Josefin and an older brother named Axel.&nbsp;Her twin sister is a qualified barrister in countries such as England and Sweden.</span></p><p><span>Elin Nordegren grew up in Stockholm, where she completed her elementary and high school education.&nbsp;She and her sister were responsible young adults and worked summer jobs to pay for school.&nbsp;As a child, Nordegren aspired to become a child psychologist.&nbsp;However, she did not pursue this path for unknown reasons.&nbsp;She worked more as a model in 2000 before becoming a nanny for Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik’s family.</span></p><h2><strong><span>children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Elin Nordegren first met husband Tiger Woods in the 2001 British Open.&nbsp;Her employer had introduced them both and they then started dating.&nbsp;The couple got engaged in November 2003 and tied the knot a year later on the 5th&nbsp;</span><span>of</span><span>&nbsp;October 2004. The wedding took place on a golf course in Barbados and the couple settled in Orlando Florida.&nbsp;Their union of six years produced a daughter named Sam Alexis (b. 2007) and a son named Charlie Axel (b. 2009).</span></p><p><span>However, their marriage fell apart in November 2009 after it was revealed that the golf great was involved in several extramarital affairs.&nbsp;At first, Elin Nordegren was determined to see if they could pull it off.&nbsp;However, after many women came forward claiming to be having an affair with Woods, she threw in the towel.</span></p><span>The couple filed for their divorce in Florida on the 23rd&nbsp;</span><span>of</span><span>&nbsp;August 2010. They share custody of their children as part of their divorce settlement.&nbsp;Since the divorce, the friendship between the two has improved.&nbsp;They communicate regularly and things are friendly with each other.&nbsp;Elin Nordegren, for her part, completed a psychology course at Rollins College.&nbsp;She performed well in her studies and received an outstanding senior award.</span><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Elin Nordegren has pretty much flown under the radar since her split from Tiger Woods.&nbsp;Her exact net worth is not publicly known, but she is known to have received at least $100 million in the divorce proceedings.&nbsp;Nordegren has put the enormous money to good use.&nbsp;She used part of it to buy a $12 million old mansion.&nbsp;The entire mansion was demolished and a new 21,000-foot home was built in its place.&nbsp;The new digs feature a home theater, nine bedrooms, a swimming pool and miniature golf course.&nbsp;The house is only 30 minutes from Tiger Woods house.&nbsp;very ideal for raising their children together.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Tiger Woods Ex-Wife Dating?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Elin Nordegren has been involved in somerelationships since their divorce.&nbsp;She is said to have dated American businessman Jamie Dingman.&nbsp;Their relationship started in the summer of 2011 but they broke it off in January 2012.&nbsp;It seems she was the one who called it off as sources revealed she wasn’t ready to start anything serious just yet.</span></p><p><span>Elin Nordegren is also said to have dated compatriot Douglas Murray.&nbsp;Murray is a professional ice hockey player.&nbsp;He played in the NHL but is now retired.&nbsp;It must be said that this relationship has never been confirmed and may just be a rumour.</span></p><p><span>Nordegren has also dated Chris Cline.&nbsp;Cline is a billionaire businessman and owner of one of the most valuable coal companies in the world.&nbsp;The two are neighbors in the North Palm Beach community and started dating in 2012/2013.&nbsp;It was reported that they broke up in 2014.&nbsp;However, they were spotted kissing in Switzerland in 2016.&nbsp;However, as of this writing, it’s not clear what status Erin holds in relation to Cline.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Cassandra Marino?
