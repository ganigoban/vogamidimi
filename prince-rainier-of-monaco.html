His strength of character supported him through the grief of his wife's fatal car accident, his children's sometimes troubled lives and, in his final years, seemingly endless bouts with ill-health.</p><p id=eNlqSHRYjP data-wc=48>Born in 1923 to parents Prince Pierre and Princess Charlotte, the young prince studied in England, Switzerland and France before joining the French army as a foreign serviceman in 1944. His mother renounced the throne in 1944, leaving Rainier to succeed his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/caaf73fb7ca9-prince-rainier-monaco-grace-kelly.jpg><p id=eJmR5yUvRc data-wc=78>The new ruler then set about modernising the tiny kingdom which covers less than one square mile sandwiched between the South of France and the Mediterranean. Rainier had been on the throne for seven years when he met the beautiful American actress <a class=hm-link href=#>Grace Kelly</a>, who was in Monaco filming the Hitchcock classic <i>To Catch A Thief</i> a film which ironically included scenes on the twisty mountain roads behind Monte Carlo where the actress would meet her untimely death.</p><h2>Prince Rainier's marriage to Grace Kelly</h2><p id=eefwvoJ9Ehz data-wc=77>After a whirlwind romance, Prince Rainier and the princess of the silver screen had a <a class=hm-link href=#>fairytale wedding in 1956</a>. Hollywood itself could not have come up with a better script, and as Grace Kelly became Princess Grace of Monaco, she cut short a highly successful acting career. The year after they were married <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Caroline</a> was born, and Prince Rainier's new bride gave the people of Monaco their heir to the throne, <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Albert</a>, the following year.</p><p id=eSWicOXPuo data-wc=97>The couple's younger daughter Stephanie was born in 1965. The magical status Monaco acquired under the reign of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace was shattered in 1982 when the universally adored princess was killed in a motoring accident. It was a tragedy from which the family never seemed to recover, and it has been said that Prince Rainier, deprived of the stricter presence of his wife, was too soft on his children. The loss of Princess Grace particularly affected <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Stephanie</a>, who was also in the car at the time of the incident and was badly injured.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9909652113ca-grace-kelly-z.jpg><p id=eNF2fj4vwK data-wc=104>After his wife's untimely death, the head of the Grimaldi clan immersed himself in his work, which focused on continuing to attract big business to the principality while aiming to rely less on income from tourism and the casino. He maintained a favourable relationship with neighbouring France despite criticism at times from the government in Paris and over the last 20 years of his reign increased the size of his kingdom from 150 hectares to 181 through various land reclamation schemes. In his last years, Rainier had endured several bouts of ill health and been hospitalised on numerous occasions with heart and respiratory problems.</p><p id=eQsZTtREzC data-wc=15><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Albert at 65 - his Olympic career, marriage to Princess Charlene and more</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eLT5OtDncI data-wc=81>His last public appearance was in January 2005 when he helped hand out prizes at his beloved Circus Festival. Earlier that week he had been moved to tears when the assembled audience, relieved to see their ailing monarch up and about again, greeted him with a standing ovation. However, just six weeks later he was back in hospital with a chest infection and, after his condition took a sudden turn for the worse, was transferred to intensive care in late March.</p><p id=eoIBIv-M_I data-wc=44>The prince's long reign came to an end on April 6, 2005, when he passed away aged 81. Popular Rainier was survived by his son and successor, Prince Albert, daughters Caroline and Stephanie, and seven grandchildren: Andrea, <a class=hm-link href=#>Charlotte</a>, Pierre, Alexandra, Louis, Pauline and Camille.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9sbWdkvbO1zZycZqqRnruqsdFmpp9lnaS7oq%2FOaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
