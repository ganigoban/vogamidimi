The captain lists the activities Tumi and Kyle Viljoen have planned to entertain the guests, including a shopping trip and foam party at a pool.</p><p>Tumi enlists Max Salvador and Lily Davison to set up the foam party while she and Kyle take the guests to Portofino for lunch and shopping. The chief stew meets with Kyle, Lily, and Jessika Asai to go over the schedule and everyone’s duties.</p><p>Before heading out for the day, Tumi confirms the dinner menu with chef Jack Luby. Even out with the guests, Tumi can’t shake the pressure, calling Jessika to make sure that Lily and Max head out to set up the foam party on time.</p><p>In all honestly, Tumi has a right to be worried because Max and Lily do more playing around than setting up in the video footage. They are having a grand old time, laughing and joking like they don’t have a care in the world.</p><p>While the interior team works to entertain the guests off of the yacht, <a href=#>Luka Brunton</a> reflects on his first season as bosun. Luka admits it was a learning curve, but spills dealing with Max challenged him the most.</p><p>Max proves Luka’s point when he gathers Haleigh Gorman and Max to clean and organize the yacht.

Tumi is forced to do damage control to keep the already upset guests happy.</p><p>Deckhand Lara Du Preez makes it back in time for the end of the charter and the last crew night out, which will be a doozy. Natalya Scudder causes a stir when she shows up to have a few drinks with the group.</p><p>Not only do Kyle and Tumi freak out, but Jessika loses it after Natalya makes a beeline for Luka. This leads Jessika to make out with Max as revenge, but she doesn’t anger Luka, just Lily.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>It’s the end of the road for<a href=#> Below Deck Med Season 8</a>.</p><p>Who’s ready for the finale episode of<a href=#> Season 8 of Below Deck Med?</a></p><p>Below Deck Med airs Mondays at 9/8c on Bravo.
