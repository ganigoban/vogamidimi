If you ask a majority of people that follow the genre, the reviews may not be glowing. The Source magazine co-founder from Boston, Massachusetts is probably mostly known for his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">never-ending saga</a> with legendary Detroit rapper <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Eminem</a>, and it is probably why he gets so much hate. A lot of fans respect Em's stature in rap and if you try to tear him down, you are going get to get backlash for it. But Ben is seemingly earning some respect as of late over a recent interview clip.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In his appearance on the We In Miami Podcast, the rapper and businessman was asked about the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fury of rumors surrounding</a> <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Meek Mill</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a>. Of course, the host is referring to the speculation that these two were sexually involved with one another. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Unlike</a> <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a>, Benzino had no jokes to make. Instead, he showed great compassion for them during his impassioned response.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-benzino-shows-compassion-for-diddy-amp-meek-mill>Benzino Shows Compassion For Diddy & Meek Mill</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It's none of our f***ing business if [Diddy] and Meek Mill are f***ing or not f***ing," Benzino said. "The internet makes all our business everybody's business. At least the privacy of what we're doing in our bedroom should be private." The interviewer interjected, saying that Meek is painted as a "real street n****," but Benzino believes that does not matter one bit. "That's a different narrative because real street n****s can be gay. Like we again we gotta be adults and we gotta look at this for what it is." He continued, "You can't have a personal opinion on who a n**** f***s unless you are in the room with them."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on the opinion that Benzino has about Meek Mill and Diddy's situation? Were you surprised he had this positive of a response to the question, why or why not? Do you agree with the fans speculation that he is "a gay man defending another gay man?"
