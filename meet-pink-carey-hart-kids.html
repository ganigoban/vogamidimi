Worryingly, his symptoms were far worse than his mom's, lasting nearly three weeks, although they fortunately both recovered fully.

In February 2021, the singer shared a video on TikTok in which she attempted to teach him the lyrics to her song with Willow, "Cover Me In Sunshine."</p><p id=eaDPlLPGR7D data-wc=28>Instead of singing the lyrics back, he growled them - which Pink found hilarious. When she asked him what version he was singing, he responded: "The low version".</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="P!nk returns to the stage with incredible performance after upsetting health news" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2cb0793a18a3-gettyimages-871914706.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="P!nk returns to the stage with incredible performance after upsetting health news" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>P!nk returns to the stage with incredible performance after upsetting health news</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Pink's ultra-private home in Santa Barbara with husband Carey Hart and two kids" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3772e9de3157-pink-home-in-santa-barbara.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Pink's ultra-private home in Santa Barbara with husband Carey Hart and two kids" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Pink's ultra-private home in Santa Barbara with husband Carey Hart and two kids</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eWoRTpfyCBp data-wc=66>As he turned six in 2023, Pink wrote of the difficulty she had in having Jameson, saying: "They said we couldn't have you.
