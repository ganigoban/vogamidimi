AEW is currently recording Collision for this upcoming Saturday, December 9th, 2023.</p><p>Our ring announcer for tonight is Dasha.</p><p>The commentary team consists of Tony Schiavone, Nigel McGuiness, and Kevin Kelly.</p><p>During the show, Dasha pointed out a fan dressed as Tony, holding a “Tony Schiavone, Are You My Dad?” sign.</p><p>Tony Khan made a surprise appearance and extended a warm welcome to AEW in Montreal, mentioning it was his first visit to the city. He also announced that TSN would be airing Collision this week and expressed his excitement for more coverage of Collision and Rampage in Canada. The crowd erupted in chants for Tony as he left the stage.</p><p>The opening match of the night features Claudio Castagnoli taking on Eddie Kingston in the Continental Classic. It was an absolutely outstanding contest that is highly recommended for anyone to watch. Kingston secured the victory by reversing a pinfall attempt, making this match truly exceptional.</p><p>Moving on to our second bout, we have two homegrown Canadian talents squaring off as Kenny Omega goes head-to-head with Ethan Page. Kenny Omega and Ethan Page engaged in a highly competitive match, with Omega even sporting a bloody lip, showcasing the intensity of their encounter. This was undoubtedly one of Page’s most impressive showings on AEW television in recent memory. In the end, Omega secured the victory with his devastating move, the One-Winged Angel. Both competitors displayed mutual respect for each other after the final bell. However, Omega’s celebration was cut short when he was ambushed and left incapacitated by Big Bill’s boot to the face.</p><p>The following match pitted Wardlow against Willie Mack. The two wrestlers had a competitive exchange initially, but Wardlow delivered a crushing powerbomb that left him walking away confidently, anticipating the referee’s stoppage, which indeed occurred. The audience responded with chants of “WARDLOW,” reminiscent of the chants often associated with Goldberg.</p><p>Willow Nightingale managed to secure a pinfall victory over Mercedes Martinez. However, after the match, Diamante and Mercedes Martinez launched an attack on Willow. Fortunately, Kris Statlander came to Willow’s aid.</p><p>Additionally, in another tag team contest, Penta and Komander emerged victorious against the team of Angelo Parker and Matt Menard.</p><p>The next match on the card featured Bryan Danielson taking on Andrade El Idolo. Andrade secured the victory by pinning Bryan Danielson with the hammerlock DDT. It was an extremely physical encounter where both competitors brought their A-game and went all out against each other. Danielson even suffered a cut above his eye, adding to the intensity of the match. After the bout, the Blackpool Combat Club checked on Danielson to ensure his well-being.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX90e5BrZmltX5ayuHnCqKOloaOevK950qmmoqSVp3qzsdKuo62rXZu8s3nDnpqepZKav26FjGtna2tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
