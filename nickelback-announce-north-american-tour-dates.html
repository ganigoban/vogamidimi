This is Nickelback’s first tour under their Live Nation Artist Nation deal which was announced earlier this year.</p><p>Nickelback are a phenomenally successful touring band whose tours have grossed in excess of $100 million thus far and have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Dark Horse is Nickelback’s first release since the immensely popular All The Right Reasons, released in 2005. In support of the album, the band has recently appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The American Music Awards. Critics and fans alike are praising Dark Horse. The New York Times raved, “Nickelback … has been responsible for some of the heaviest pop hits of this decade and more notably, it has almost single handedly preserved the idea of the arena-rock ballad.” Entertainment Weekly declared, “The only sure thing in the music business in 2008.”</p><p>The first single, “Gotta Be Somebody,” is topping the charts with impressive numbers: Top 5 Rock, Top 10 Modern, Top 5 Hot A/C and Top 15 at Pop. At press time, the track has an estimated audience of over 45 million. The band is currently appearing in a major advertising campaign with Citi, featuring Nickelback in network and cable TV, print and online ads throughout November and December, showcasing “Gotta Be Somebody.”</p><p>Nickelback re-launched their official fan club website on November 13th where members can gain exclusive access to advance concert tickets, limited-edition merchandise, candid photos, audio and video. The site offers members exclusives, including special contests for merchandise, tickets and meet and greets with the band. There’s also a new social platform enabling members to network and chat with other members via message boards, a live chat room, blogs and many other interactive features. Members will have access to pre-sale ticketing beginning November 25th.

The Roadrunner catalog boasts early releases from such seminal artists as Type O Negative, Sepultura and King Diamond. More recently, the label has experienced unprecedented success with multi-platinum artists Nickelback and Slipknot, gold-certified Stone Sour and Killswitch Engage, as well as modern heavy hitters Theory of a Deadman, Dream Theater, and Megadeth. Though primarily known as a hard rock label, Roadrunner’s roster also includes diverse acts such as The Dresden Dolls and newcomers Black Stone Cherry, Madina Lake, Airbourne and The Wombats. Still headquartered in the Netherlands, Roadrunner occupies offices in New York, now the A&R hub for the label, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France, Japan and Australia.
