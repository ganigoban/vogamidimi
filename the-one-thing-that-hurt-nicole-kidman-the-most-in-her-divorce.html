Kidman told <a href=#>DuJour</a>&nbsp;that she was happy during most of the time and that she didn't think her marriage would end the way it did.&nbsp;"It took me a very long time to heal. It was a shock to my system,"&nbsp;she said. Kidman did try to save her marriage and even wanted Cruise to give their union a second chance. In response to the actor's divorce petition, Kidman apparently&nbsp;"protested [Cruise's] intention to dissolve their marriage and urged him not to leave but to enter marriage counseling with her," but Cruise wasn't having it, per <a href=#>ABC News</a>. As far as Cruise was concerned, they were done and there was no turning back. Kidman was hurt, but Cruise was adamant that she had no place in his future anymore.</p><p>Kidman also told DuJour that, because <a href=#>her split from Cruise was so heartbreaking</a>, she never thought she would find love again. She said, "Our life together was perfect. It took me a very long time to heal." But there was another painful secret Kidman kept to herselfâ€” the massive grief she experienced while married to one of the biggest Hollywood stars in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW1maIJze9OhnGannpp6tbTIp55mrJiWwW601KurZqaZmLytsYykoJ2lkaN6tbTEZqSoq6Ritq95x56pZpyZq7yzr8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
