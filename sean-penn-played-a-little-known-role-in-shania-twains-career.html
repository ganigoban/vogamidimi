Still, her future started to look bright after she released her self-titled first album in 1993. That's when Sean Penn arrived on the scene and played a little-known role in Twain's career.</p><p>"All of a sudden Sean Penn calls and says, 'I'd love to direct one of your videos,'" she told <a href=#>"Extra."</a> Twain said that when they met in person to discuss the project, Penn thrust $100 into her hand, telling her, "You look like you could use this," which sounds kind of insulting, but Twain admitted that she'd "really needed it" at the time. "It was a really kind thing to do," she said. Penn ultimately directed <a href=#>"Dance With The One That Brought You,"</a> the second single from Twain's debut album.</p><p>Meanwhile, Penn may have been the first, but there were plenty more famous fans to come, including Adele, who totally fangirled over the country great after noticing her in the audience. "Thank God you had a hat on... I would have self-combusted had I seen it was you. I adore you. I can't believe you came to my show," Adele captioned an Instagram Story of her singing while Twain watched (via <a href=#>E! News</a>). "That was so special," Twain told <a href=#>"Extra"</a> at the People's Choice Awards. "It was cute; it was very sweet of her," she continued.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpa4VxfI6snJqmXaWyr7qMqaOasZWZeqJ5y6KrraSVYrivu9anZKunnJp6qrqMrJ%2BappmWerXDwKKlrGWTlr%2BmsdFo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
