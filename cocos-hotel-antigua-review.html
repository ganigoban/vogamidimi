With picture-postcard palm-fringed beaches, verdant tropical rainforests and a charming colonial capital, St John's, this West Indies island is ripe for exploration.</p><p id=e612hG3DI8c data-wc=57>It's also a honeymoon paradise with golden sunsets, aquamarine sea and plenty of gorgeous hotels to suit all tastes and budgets. In fact, Lionel Messi, the world’s greatest footballer, has chosen it for his honeymoon with new wife Antonella Roccuzzo , who's been keeping her Instagram followers up to date with envy-inducing images of the sun-drenched island.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=eYuTy9UTqO1F data-wc=7><strong>Lionel Messi went on honeymoon in Antigua</strong></p><p id=etQUJy0wztZD data-wc=41>So when <strong>HELLO! Online</strong> was invited out to sample the delights of Cocos Hotel, an intimate boutique-style property on the south west of the island, we were booking a flight faster than you can say 'make mine a rum punch, please.'</p><p id=eF3xizCU8M6F><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: Prince Harry's Caribbean royal tour - how to holiday like the royal</a></p><p id=e675L8KhlUzC data-wc=63>The beautiful couples-only resort is perched on a secluded ocean bluff – meaning there are spectacular, Instagram-worthy views everywhere you turn. I think I'd taken at least 20 photos while I was lounging in the open-air reception area (which has a bar, and, handily, a book library – perfect for stocking up on beachside reading) before we'd even checked in to our room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba7cb09f6010-1-cocos-hotel-sunset-lounge-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=epFvlWdX0fi3 data-wc=9><strong>The sunset lounge has incredible views across the ocean</strong></p><p id=eVTC4ZsBJoiZ data-wc=81>There were more photo opportunities as soon as we arrived at our beautifully-rustic wooden cottage. There are 30 in total, each with its own private veranda, large bathroom with his'n'hers sinks, and an outdoor shower. All of them are clean, comfortable and feature dark wooden floors, crisp white linens and a well-stocked fridge, but if it's a special occasion I'd recommend splashing out – and splashing around - in the signature Sunset Plunge Pool Cottage, where there's a private infinity pool…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/84b45df086e9-2-cocos-hotel-plunge-pool-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eQXBkB_h_OUF data-wc=12><strong>The signature Sunset Plunge Pool Cottage is well worth splashing out on</strong></p><p id=eCSzlcpof-SB data-wc=101>How gorgeous is that?! Ten out of ten on the romance front. (Our room didn't have one of those pools but we had a tranquil view of the hotel's swimming pool and the beach from our veranda, which was lovely too. Plus we had a king-sized four-poster bed, and who doesn't love a king-sized four-poster bed?) The vibe of the charming, family-run hotel is very much unpretentious chic, and most of the dressy items of clothing I took with me with sunset cocktails and evening meals in mind remained in my suitcase in favour of simple floaty dresses and flip flops.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5707d56e5b94-3-cocos-hotel-main-pool-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e6pvZBr4uB5X data-wc=11><strong>The main swimming pool is located just metres from the beach</strong></p><p id=e06RBhG4pe2P data-wc=118>It really is a haven of relaxation and if you want to unwind even more, I'd recommend one of the massages in the hotel’s Serenity Cottage, which is basic but offers fantastic body treatments. There are also yoga and pilates classes available to try. In Antigua there are tanning opportunities aplenty given the island's year-round average temperature of 27 degrees, so while the hotel can organise a wealth of excursions – including jet skiing, sailing trips, day visits to St John's and cruises to neighbouring Barbuda - the beach is where we (lazily!) spent most of our time. There's a beach bar serving up everything from local beers (we love a nice cold Wadadli) and piña coladas (mmm!)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b51ca7b16155-4-cocos-hotel-beach-umbrella-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e58_bHs5oi-R data-wc=10><strong>The beach is so beautiful you'll be reluctant to leave</strong></p><p id=eDWUZ4oNU4YC data-wc=42>By the way, the hotel may be all inclusive but the cocktails do contain proper ingredients. (If you fancy something sweet we'd recommend the BBC which is made with Baileys and banana and is absolutely delicious! There are also daily rum specials.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54abc1121141-5-cocos-hotel-beach-bar-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eMqoWojuWl7A data-wc=11><strong>Pay a visit to the beach bar for daily rum specials</strong></p><p id=eYKoV9xOMz2t data-wc=96>Likewise, food in the restaurant – which has been named the most romantic restaurant in Antigua on more than one occasion – is à la carte, and unlike in other all inclusive resorts I've stayed in, is different every night. Expect to splurge at breakfast (bacon and eggs, pancakes, fruit platters, French toast, cereal, freshly-baked cakes…) and have plenty of freshly-caught fish at dinner, where the menu is international with strong local influences. If you have a special occasion to celebrate the staff will bend over backwards to reserve you a special spot in the restaurant.</p><p id=e2xZ2EFoFjH8 data-wc=40>On our memorable last night we pre-ordered champagne and sat at the edge of the top tier of the restaurant, overlooking the sparkling ocean as a local band played live calypso music and we watched the sun go down. Bliss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/25ee877c56eb-6-cocos-hotel-sunset-view-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ezHT4kfJbLSQ data-wc=15><strong>It's easy to see why the restaurant has been named the most romantic in Antigua</strong></p><p id=ea9kBFz8f_n6 data-wc=28>It really is a wonderfully romantic spot. No wonder so many couples choose to honeymoon here, and celebrities continue to flock to Antigua.
