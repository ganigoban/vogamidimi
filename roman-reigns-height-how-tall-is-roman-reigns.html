He is a member of the legendary Anoa’i wrestling family, which includes Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Yokozuna, and Rikishi.</p><p>Reigns attended Escambia High School in Pensacola, where he played football as a defensive tackle. He later attended Georgia Institute of Technology, where he played for the Yellow Jackets football team. After college, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings as an undrafted free agent but was cut from the team in 2007.</p><p>In 2010, Reigns signed a developmental contract with WWE and was assigned to their developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling. He made his WWE debut in 2012 as a member of The Shield, a faction that also included Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins. The Shield quickly became one of the most popular and dominant groups in WWE, winning numerous championships and feuding with some of the biggest names in the company.</p><p>Reigns made his singles debut in 2014 and quickly became one of the top stars in WWE. He won his first WWE World Heavyweight Championship in 2015 and has gone on to win the championship four more times, as well as numerous other titles. He has also main-evented multiple WrestleManias, WWE’s biggest annual event.</p><p>In addition to his success in WWE, Reigns has also pursued acting.
