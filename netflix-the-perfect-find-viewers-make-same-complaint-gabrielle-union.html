One person wrote: "<strong>Why did you guys rush the story?&nbsp;</strong>Mistake to go with #GabrielleUnion if unavailable for series and for a quick buck. Made for hollow characters. Why not make a series? The friends, dynamics of old-young relationship... just such untapped potential #letdown," while another added: "I feel like they kinda rushed this movie but whatever it was okay #ThePerfectFindNetflix."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c3292ebcf179-the-perfect-find-2-gabrielle.jpg><p id=edVRtvIiwRr data-wc=76>A third person tweeted: "<strong>The movie was a bit too rushed, too all over the place&nbsp;</strong>imo. They didn't give their love enough time to develop and me enough time to consume it. There were too many things happening all at once and too many loose ends. But the casting was perfect tho," while another added: "I definitely would have loved a mini-series of this.
