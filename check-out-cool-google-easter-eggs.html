Here are some of the best ones you should check out at least once.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=i-rsquo-m-feeling-curious>I’m Feeling Curious</h2><p>If you're interested in fun facts about things happening around you, like Mark Wahlberg's nationality or the importance of Zeus in Roman mythology, you should search for "I'm Feeling Curious" on Google. This will give you a random fun fact about anything in the world. The last time I checked, it told me the reason behind the northern lights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/i-m-feeling-curious-google-easter-egg.jpg><h2 id=lgbt-easter-egg>LGBT Easter Egg</h2><p>If you're part of the LGBT community or support them, you'll definitely love the <a href=#>Easter Egg</a> Google created for them. Just type <strong>LGBT</strong> into Google and hit Enter. In the search results window, click the heart icon, and then you'll see moving hands holding LGBT flags.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/lgbt-google-easter-egg.jpg><p>There's also a cool LGBT Easter Egg in <a href=#>Google Sheets</a>. Simply open a new spreadsheet in Google Sheets, type <strong>PRIDE</strong> across the top row with each letter in a separate column, and hit Enter. The columns of the Google Sheet will turn rainbow colors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rainbow-color-colums-in-google-sheet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bubble-level>Bubble Level</h2><p>A spirit level is a tool that lets you check if a surface is horizontal or vertical. If you don't have one handy, you can turn your smartphone into a spirit level. Just open Google on your smartphone, type <strong>Bubble Level </strong>or<strong> Spirit Level</strong> in the search bar, and hit Enter. In the results window, tap the "Touch to Activate" option. Then, your smartphone will act like a spirit level and show you how much it's tilted in one direction or another.</p><span class=txt>Close</span><h2 id=dvd-screensaver>DVD Screensaver</h2><p>Remember that old DVD screensaver that used to come on, and we'd wait for it to hit the corner? You can actually bring that back on Google, too. Just head to Google on your desktop computer, type in <strong>DVD screensaver</strong>, and hit Enter. Then, after a few seconds, you'll see the Google logo start bouncing around the screen, moving from one side to the other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dvd-screensaver-easter-egg-in-chrome.jpg><h2 id=dart-mission>Dart Mission</h2><p>If you're a space enthusiast, then you must be aware of NASA's DART spacecraft. It was intentionally collided with the asteroid Dimorphos in a test of the world's first planetary defense system. To celebrate the mission's success, Google introduced a DART Easter Egg. To try it out, type <strong>NASA DART</strong> in the Google search bar and hit Enter. In the results window, you'll see the DART spacecraft crash into the search page.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nasa-dart-easter-egg-in-chrome.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christmas>Christmas</h2><p>One of the best and most entertaining Easter Eggs you can try is Christmas. The best part is that it works on both smartphones and desktops. Simply access Google on your device and search for "Christmas." In the result window, you will see a jumping gift animation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gift-icon-on-christmas-easter-egg.jpg><p>Then, click on that animation, and you will be taken to the Google Santa Tracker page, which contains a countdown timer showing the time left until the next Christmas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-santa-tracker-page.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can click the play button to access games made available for you. There are a variety of games, and each appears randomly, so there is no guarantee that clicking the play button will open a specific game. Sometimes, clicking the play button can also show you an animated movie about Santa instead of giving you a game to play.</p><h2 id=sonic-the-hedgehog>Sonic the Hedgehog</h2><p>Sonic the Hedgehog is a popular video game series. To celebrate its success, Google added a fun Easter Egg related to it. You can try it by simply typing <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong> in the Google search bar and hitting Enter. You'll see the Sonic character appear on the results page. Click on him, and you'll hear a sound and see him perform some animations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sonic-the-hedgehog-easter-egg-in-chrome.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=google-doodles>Google Doodles</h2><p>Google has a bunch of games in its <a href=#>Google Doodle</a> archive that you can play whenever you have some free time. To play these games, just type <strong>Google Doodles </strong>in the search bar and hit Enter. You'll see a list of different games available in the Google Doodle archive. Just click on the game you want and start playing!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-doodles-easter-egg-in-chrome.jpg><h2 id=google-has-removed-many-easter-eggs-but-there-39-s-a-way-to-still-access-them>Google Has Removed Many Easter Eggs, But There's a Way to Still Access Them</h2><p>There used to be a ton of Easter Eggs you could try on Google. Unfortunately, Google has officially removed them. However, you can still try them out through the Elgoog website, which restores all the Easter Eggs that Google has gotten rid of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=zerg-rush>Zerg Rush</h3><p>Zerg Rush is a cool Easter Egg you must try. This Easter Egg features "Zergs" that try to eat the search page. Your job here is to stop them by clicking on them, which will ultimately kill them. There's also a score meter that shows the number of Zergs you've killed. So you can play a game with your friend to see who kills more Zergs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/zerg-rush-easter-egg-in-chrome.jpg><p>To play the game, go the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">main Google search page</a>, type <strong>Zerg Rush</strong> and click "I'm Feeling Lucky."</p><h3 id=dinosaur-game>Dinosaur Game</h3><p>You've probably played the dinosaur game that shows up in Google Chrome when you try to access the internet without an internet connection. The Elgoog website also has the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dinosaur game</a>, and you can play it even if you're connected to the internet. The coolest thing about the dinosaur game on the Elgoog website is that there are different versions of the game. For example, you can try the gymnastics and birthday editions of the dinosaur game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dinosaur-game-easter-egg-in-chrome.jpg><h3 id=google-gravity>Google Gravity</h3><p>If you want to see how Google reacts when it comes into contact with gravity, you can try the Google Gravity Easter Egg. On the main page of Google, type <strong>Google Gravity</strong> in the search bar and click "I'm Feeling Lucky." You will see all the elements of Google falling to the floor due to gravity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-gravity-easter-egg-in-chrome.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=google-underwater-gravity>Google Underwater Gravity</h3><p>You can also make the Google elements appear underwater and see them floating. On the <a href=#>Google</a> homepage, type in <strong>Google Underwater</strong> and click "I'm Feeling Lucky." In the results window, you'll see the Google logo and search bar floating underwater.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-underwater-gravity-easter-egg-in-chrome.jpg><p>These were some Google Easter Eggs you should try out. But these aren't the only ones. There are still <a href=#>plenty of Easter Eggs</a> out there on the internet, and Google will likely keep releasing more in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGiaoZ2ToHqwwdNmmqinnGK0sLvGpZxmnZGowaa%2BjJ6eoKtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
