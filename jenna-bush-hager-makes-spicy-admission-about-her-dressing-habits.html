She doesn't like to wear underwear, so she rarely puts on undergarments in the morning. Yep. Really. <a href=#>Hoda Kotb</a> outed her co-star on <a href=#>"Today"</a> on November 16, when she revealed she got a bit of an eyeful during a recent quick change with her co-star. Jenna defended her decision though, hitting back, "I think it makes a more pretty silhouette! I also think you don't have to pack as much. [There are] a lot of pros to it!" She then joked Kotb promised she wouldn't say anything about her being a commando aficionado, before bringing her mom, Laura Bush, into the equation by joking, "I'm sure my mom has never been more proud."</p><p>While the admission was no doubt pretty surprising, it actually wasn't the first time Kotb has outed her co-star. She and their "Today" co-star Savannah Guthrie admitted in a Truth or Dare game for <a href=#>"Good Housekeeping"</a>'s April issue that Jenna is an underwear dodger. "Jenna has a million gross habits. She doesn't wear underwear most days," Kotb revealed at the time. Guthrie then seconded the confession as she admitted of Jenna, "I know because she borrows my clothes and she's not dry cleaning them either, let's be honest." It sounds like the ladies over at "Today" are even closer than we thought!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlga4B4f46jnKemkWKvtr%2FHZp%2Ban5Wneq6typ6qZqugnrC6ecCdpKKro568r3nAm6aurF2dsrN5w6ucrKuZo7RutMCboK2rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
