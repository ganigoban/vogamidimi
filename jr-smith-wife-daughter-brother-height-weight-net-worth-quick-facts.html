He entered the Sprite Rising Stars Slam Dunk competition that year and finished third, finishing behind Amare Stoudemire and Josh Smith.</span></p><p><span>The standard JR Smith set in its first season was unfortunately unpaired in its second full year.&nbsp;The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina could have played a role since the team had to play its games in Oklahoma City.&nbsp;Additionally, Chris Paul’s drafting meant that Smith’s role was shortened as did his stat line.</span></p><p><span>For the 2006-07 season, the Hornets decided to trade Smith for the Chicago Bulls in a package with PJ Brown for Tyson Chandler.&nbsp;He was then traded by the Bulls to the Denver Nuggets for two second-round picks and Howard Eisley.</span></p><p><span>Smith’s time in Denver was full of ups and downs.&nbsp;Just months after signing, the New Jersey native was embroiled in the infamous Knicks-Nuggets brawl which led to a 10-game suspension.&nbsp;Later in the season, he suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee, but he still managed to play a part in the playoffs that year.&nbsp;In October 2007, he was involved in an accident at a Denver nightclub, which resulted in a three-game suspension.&nbsp;After this incident, Smith began to focus more on his game helping his team reach the playoffs, including making it to the Western Conference Finals.&nbsp;In one season, he had the second most points in the league.</span></p><p><span>JR Smith spent the 2011-12 season in China playing for the Zhejiang Golden Bulls due to the NBA lockout.&nbsp;He returned the following season and signed for the New York Knicks.&nbsp;In his second year with the Knicks, Smith received the Sixth Man award.&nbsp;This made him a fan favorite as he was the first Knick since John Starks in the 1996–97 season to win the award.</span></p><p><span>On January 5, 2015, Smith alongside teammate ImanShumpert was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers where he found some stability alongside Lebron James for the first time in his career.&nbsp;In Cleveland, he set the franchise playoff three-pointer record with eight points scored from three points off the bench against the Atlanta Hawks.&nbsp;The team lost the 2015 NBA Finals to the Golden State Warriors.</span></p><p><span>He re-signed with the team the following season and won his first and only championship to date when the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a series.&nbsp;He is also currently ranked 11th on the NBA’s 3-pointers list.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>The net worth of JR Smith is around $20 million dollars.&nbsp;This is largely due to his fairly lucrative contract with the NBA.&nbsp;With such a sum of money in the bank, it is the only right that one spoils himself from time to time.&nbsp;In the case of JR Smith, he buys cars.&nbsp;He currently owns several luxury vehicles, including a Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, a Ferrari 458, a Range Rover, a Mercedes-Benz S550 and G550, and a Bentley Mulsanne.</span></p><h2><strong><span>JR Smith’s Family – Wife, Daughter, Brother</span></strong></h2><p><span>JR Smith comes from a large family.&nbsp;He has three brothers and two sisters.&nbsp;One of his younger brothers, Chris, played in Manhattan and Louisville before briefly playing alongside him for the Knicks in the 2013-14 season.&nbsp;His other brother, Dimitrius, plays football and is currently at Monmouth University.</span></p><p><span>In 2016, Smith married Jewel Harris.&nbsp;The couple have three daughters named Dakota, Demi and Peyton.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Quick facts (height, weight)</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>Birth Name:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Earl Joseph “JR” Smith III</span></p><p><strong><span>Place of birth:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Freehold Terminal, New Jersey</span></p><p><strong><span>Date of birth:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;September 9, 1985</span></p><p><strong><span>Nationality:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;American</span></p><p><strong><span>Height:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)</span></p><p><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;225 lbs (102 kg)</span></p><p><strong><span>Civil status:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Married</span></p><p><strong><span>Net worth:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;$20 million</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiiomLArrXToWSwoZaaeqWt1KCfrZ2iYq%2Bzu9OhnKtlmJq2qLTTZq6eoZedwW66xK1ksKeiqbVuvdSimqRllpawtb%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
