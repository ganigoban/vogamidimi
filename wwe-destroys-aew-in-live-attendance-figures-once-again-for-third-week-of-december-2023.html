Now, we have the live attendance numbers that both companies were able to pull in this week for their television shows.</p><p><a href=#>WrestleTix&nbsp;</a>recently compiled attendance figures for WWE and AEW television shows this week. Among the shows, <a href=#>Monday Night RAW</a> had the most audience this week, which was definitely a shocker considering Friday Night SmackDown has usually been the dominant one among the two brands. On the other hand, AEW Collision had the least attendance among any of the shows, which is nothing unexpected now.</p><p>Monday Night RAW on 11th December 2023 took place in Cleveland, OH at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, where they sold 9,552 tickets. AEW Dynamite took place in College Park Center in Arlington, Texas&nbsp;and drew an audience of 3,659.</p><p>The December 15th episode of Friday Night Smackdown took place in Green Bay, WI at the Resch Center and managed to sell 6,240 tickets, while AEW Collision also took place at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas and had an audience of 2,736.</p><p>This week’s RAW featured a highly intense promo battle between Seth Rollins and CM Punk, where Punk proved to be a massive draw for fans in attendance. AEW brought in a solid episode of Dynamite thanks to the Continental Classic tournament as well.</p><p>Evidently, it comes as no surprise that WWE has once again demolished AEW when it came to live attendance figures. The pro wrestling world is full of action, and we can’t wait to bring you all the news here at&nbsp;<a href=#>Ringside News</a>!
