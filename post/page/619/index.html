Tommy Roe (born May 9, 1942, in Atlanta, Georgia) is an American pop music singer-songwriter who is best known for his work with the Carpenters. Roe was most known for his successful singles “Sheila” (1962) and “Dizzy” (1969), but he was also “widely regarded as one of the classic bubblegum singers of the late 1960s, but recorded some fairly good rockers along the way, particularly early in his career,” according to Allmusic writer Bill Dahl. <a href=../../../tommy-roe-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../post/page/618/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
