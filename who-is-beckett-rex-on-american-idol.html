While the reason for his exit remains undisclosed, Rex had previously released original music including the singles “Wildfire” and “Pale Blue Eyes”.</p><p>In fact, he collaborated with Pierre Bouvier, the lead singer of Simple Plan, who happened to be one of his neighbors, and together they released an eight-song EP titled “Weirdo” in 2020.</p><p>Despite the disappointment of leaving the competition, Rex continues to make music and pursue his passion for singing.
