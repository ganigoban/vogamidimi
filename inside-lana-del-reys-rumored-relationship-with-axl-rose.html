Even Rose's bandmate and Guns N' Roses guitarist DJ Ashba seems to think so, too. He told <a href=#>TMZ</a> that there's probably nothing going on romantically between the two musicians.</p><p>"I don't think they are dating. Axl is a really cool dude and he likes hanging out with cool people," Ashba said. "I think that they were probably just buddy-buddy hanging out." Well, Lana Del Rey is&nbsp;indeed&nbsp;cool, but the two likely just bonded over their mutual love for rock music.</p><p>Del Rey probably scored free tickets, too. After the supposed "date," <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> reported that the singer was seen in the crowd of not one, but two Guns N' Roses concerts in Los Angeles, proving that she's definitely a big fan of the band. In fact, according to one fan, the star "didn't take her eyes off the stage. She looked like such a fan. She was in total awe of the guys on stage." Nothing like hanging out with your idol and watching him in concert shortly thereafter!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb29pZX5ye8inqqKclWK5orrAZpuepF2nsrq%2FjKuspqeimrFuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZq6irJhirrm4jKumrJ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
