I bleach my hair and I wear extensions, and in the last year, I've noticed thinning around my scalp area. I've been looking for a hair care buy that would help my hair to feel fuller while still being affordable, and with some research, Mielle seemed like the no-brainer answer I needed to try out for myself.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Iâ€™m 41 with thinning hair and credit Amazonâ€™s LED Head Massager for slowing down hair loss - read my review" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/981d74cb810e-hair-tool-for-hair-growth.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Iâ€™m 41 with thinning hair and credit Amazonâ€™s LED Head Massager for slowing down hair loss - read my review" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Iâ€™m 41 with thinning hair and credit Amazonâ€™s LED Head Massager for slowing down hair loss - read my review</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/baabb29d12b5-mielle-oil-personal.jpg><p id=e2b_nI7U8ph data-wc=70>Retailing at <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Â£9.99</a></span>/ <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">$9.24</a></span> on Amazon, the rosemary oil is described as being designed for "daily use, scalp treatment, and split-end care". The oil comes with different instructions depending on what you're looking to work on. For scalp care, Mielle recommends sectioning out the hair, applying a small amount to each section massaging in using your hands or a brush, combing the product through to the ends, and leaving in.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fff7409a660a-mielle-hair-oil.png></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>Â£9.99 (SAVE 11%) AT AMAZON</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$9.24 (SAVE 8%) AT AMAZON</p></a><p id=eOW4Jbb_MZP data-wc=71>As improving hair growth is my main concern, I followed this method on my hair wash days. Rather than leaving the product in, I washed it out after about an hour. I think the oil could be a great leave-in treatment if you have thicker hair, but if you have fine hair as I do, I would recommend trying it as a wash-out treatment first to avoid weighing your hair down.</p><p id=e2yZtxjx5AO data-wc=43>The first thing I noticed about the hair oil is the lovely mint scent that feels so fresh in your hair. I found the applicator super easy to use, as you can apply the oil to your hands or straight to your hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSETB_jaDy data-wc=87>I've been using the oil as a scalp treatment roughly once a week for two months, applying the product all over my scalp with a <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">scalp massager</a></span> as I find it gives the best coverage. On days when my hair is clean, I've been using the oil on my ends for hydration, and I'm really happy with the results. The oil doesn't make my hair feel greasy, and it gives the same glossy feel as other oils I've used before that have a much higher price tag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/71e92d20ce94-blow-out-hair.jpg><p id=ec0kx0ELSOi data-wc=25>The Mielle oil has received generally positive reviews on Amazon, with several commenting on its fresh scent and how it has improved their hair growth.&nbsp;</p><p id=efEtci4uANl data-wc=67>One wrote: "Smells like mint and tea trees. So fresh and clean. Easy to use, my hair growth has doubled since using. It used to take me a year to grow three inches; now, I get my hair trimmed at all my appointments. I bleached my hair, and it became damaged; I credit this with helping it feel soft and healthy again. I will purchase this again."&nbsp;</p><a title=@xoxobelaa href=#>@xoxobelaa</a><p>This mielle oil got everyone in a chokeholdâ€¦including me!

My hair also feels softer from applying the product to my ends, so I'm looking forward to seeing how it will benefit my hair long term (and I'll be sure to update this article as time goes on to update you with my hair growth journey). As the oil is suitable for all hair types and can be used in several different ways, I would definitely recommend trying the product if you've suffered from hair loss or would like to improve the general health of your hair.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Fans love Amazon's affordable alternative to the Dyson supersonic hairdryer - & itâ€™s in the spring sale" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2519302c4510-dyson-hairdryer-dupe.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Fans love Amazon's affordable alternative to the Dyson supersonic hairdryer - & itâ€™s in the spring sale" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Fans love Amazon's affordable alternative to the Dyson supersonic hairdryer - & itâ€™s in the spring sale</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I tried Shark's viral 5-in-1 FlexStyle Air Styler â€“ this is what I really thought" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/99d87fdd0d60-shark-flexstyle.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I tried Shark's viral 5-in-1 FlexStyle Air Styler â€“ this is what I really thought" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I tried Shark's viral 5-in-1 FlexStyle Air Styler â€“ this is what I really thought</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="7 best hair straighteners for every hair type & budget: Fine to thick hair, damaged & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/539a6abb9ac0-hair-straighteners.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="7 best hair straighteners for every hair type & budget: Fine to thick hair, damaged & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>7 best hair straighteners for every hair type & budget: Fine to thick hair, damaged & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
