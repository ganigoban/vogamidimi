Now, thanks to BossLogic, eager fans can get an idea of what the actor <a href=#>will look like</a> as Anakin Skywalker outside of the Darth Vader mask for the first time since he was charred after his final battle with Obi-Wan Kenobi.&nbsp;You can see the image below.</p><p>The image shows Ahsoka wielding her trademark dual lightsabers atop a pile of rubble as an Imperial Destroyer looms overhead. Meanwhile, in the clouds is the side profile of Darth Vader with smoke coming out of the back, forming the creepy, wounded visage of Hayden Christensen’s Vader. Although he’s still got some facial scarring, including a pronounced one over his right eye, he’s still got a classic case of the handsomes.&nbsp;</p><p>Funny enough, this isn’t the first time that Hayden Christensen has made headlines for announcing he’ll reprise his role as Anakin Skywalker. He’ll join Ewan McGregor, who is also reprising his Star Wars prequels character for a <a href=#>standalone</a> series similar to that of The Mandalorian at Disney+. In April, Disney and LucasFilm announced that Anakin would be a cast member, which made sense given that it takes place before the events of Return of the Jedi but after the events of Revenge of the Sith. So, it <a href=#>looked</a> as though that would be the first time we’d see Hayden Christensen taking on the role of Darth Vader instead of Anakin Skywalker.&nbsp;</p><p>However, what makes Hayden Christensen’s inclusion in Star Wars: Ahsoka so unique is the fact that it takes place several years after the events of Return of the Jedi when Darth Vader met his end at the hands of his son (OK, mostly the Emperor but let’s not get bogged down in semantics). In fact, she made her initial debut as a live-action character in The Mandalorian which takes place exactly five years after Vader’s death. As a result, it’s unclear how exactly <a href=#>Anakin</a> or Vader will be involved in Ahsoka’s ongoing story. However, canonically, they have quite the link. Although it never came up in the movies, Ahsoka briefly trained as a Jedi with Anakin Skywalker as her master. So, many speculate that Anakin will be around by way of either a flashback character or a Force Ghost.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, whether he’s in the Obi-Wan or the Ahsoka, Christensen’s return to the character will take place after his transition to Darth Vader. When he previously played the character, he was either a good guy or getting the mask put on his face, so not until the BossLogic image have viewers truly seen Hayden Christensen as a fully realized and scarred Darth Vader rather than Anakin Skywalker.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2igka6xprqMnJ%2BroaOpsq%2B%2FxKdknZmiqbVuwsCdnKtlkZ3AsLfAZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
