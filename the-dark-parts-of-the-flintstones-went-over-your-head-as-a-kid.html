The Flintstones had its own run with the concept, and it's pretty messed up. In "Little Bamm-Bamm," Barney and Betty had been trying to conceive a baby, but they couldn't. Then, they're given one. Bamm-Bamm shows up on their doorstep, and the world is a brighter place ... for a moment. There's a whole bunch of bureaucracy in adopting a child,&nbsp; both in the real world and the Flintstones' world. While waiting to hear back about Bamm-Bamm's adoptions, someone else is awarded custody. Barney has taken all he can.</p><p>Luckily, Bamm-Bamm's new parents find out they're going to have a baby of their own, so they don't need to adopt Bamm-Bamm. Cool, kind of. Bamm-Bamm is now a Rubble, but Barney is nowhere in sight. That's because he's on a bridge, holding a bolder, saying his last goodbyes before he jumps to his death. Fred saves him at the last second, and the children watching are only mildly scarred for the rest of their lives.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline​ at​ 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bkmpqa3BfqbWmecOaqaRloJa%2Ftb%2BMqJ1mrJiaeqe4yKerrKyfo7K0edaepa1ln6uys3nYqKyrZZiarqV5wKxkmmWbnrFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
