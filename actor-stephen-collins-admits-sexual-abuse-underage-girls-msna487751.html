I have been working to atone for it ever since. I've decided to address these issues publicly because two months ago, various news organizations published a recording made by my then-wife, Faye Grant, during a confidential marriage therapy session in January 2012. This session was recorded without the therapist's or my knowledge or consent," he reportedly wrote to<a href=#> People</a>.&nbsp;Collins and Grant are in the process of finalizing their divorce.</p><p>In the statement, Collins wrote that he twice exposed himself to a pre-teenage girl in 1973, and had another inappropriate encounter with the same individual inside his home, the "<a href=#>Today</a>" show reported on Wednesday.</p><p>"When the girl and I were watching TV alone, I moved her hand in such a way that caused her to touch me inappropriately,'' Collins wrote, according to the "Today" show report. "It was a completely impulsive act, and it's haunted me ever since to think of what I put her through."&nbsp;</p><p>Collins also admitted to exposing himself to two teenage girls in 1982 and 1994.</p><p>He&nbsp;said he directly apologized to one of the women, 15 years after the incident occurred.</p><p>Collins came under fire in October after&nbsp;celebrity gossip website TMZ released the <a href=#>audio recording</a> that his&nbsp;wife allegedly secretly taped. It&nbsp;reveals&nbsp;a man identified as Collins confessing during a therapy session to molesting three young girls. The New York Police Department also received the recording. The&nbsp;Los Angeles Police Department previously said officers couldn't verify the tape, given to them in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>"The publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what I did that go far beyond what actually occurred. As difficult as this is, I want people to know the truth," Collins added.</p><p>On Oct. 9, a victim, who was 13 years old at the time of the incident, reported a&nbsp;<a href=#>child-molestation allegation</a>&nbsp;connected to Collins. Days later, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department began investigating the accusation.</p><p>Collins added that nothing inappropriate occurred on the set of "7th Heaven."&nbsp;The TV series premiered in August 1996 and was broadcast originally until May 2007. He was&nbsp;cut from several upcoming planned TV and movie appearances following the recent allegations.</p><p>Collins, who remained out of the public eye since the recording surfaced, has not been charged with a crime. The victims have not identified themselves publicly.</p><p>His full statement will be available in the most recent edition of&nbsp;People, out Friday.</p><p class=endmark>The news comes amid spiraling allegations that<a href=#>&nbsp;Bill Cosby</a> sexually assaulted multiple women in the past. The comedian has never been charged criminally.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rr%2FNm5pnm5%2BifK6%2FzZuaaJmTqbyzedKtnKmglaN6pLvLpaCnq12Wsa6106xkrJ2oqq6tecCbrKydXaq7pbHRmp6eZZeev62%2FjKaqp5lkbYR4gZA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
