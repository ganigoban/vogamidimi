One of the boys lives on a steady diet of top ramen and chicken nuggets. Since he is such a picky eater, I knew his opinion mattered. I canâ€™t tell you how many texts I have received from his Mom wondering when I was going to share this chicken tender recipe! He was a big fan and they passed his test. Thanks goodness!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4196.jpg alt="Fried Chicken Tenders Juicy, tender, marinated chicken dipped in coating and fried until perfectly crispy.

Chicken tenders are marinated in buttermilk, which contributes to the tenderness and creates moist chicken. &nbsp;I also found that a hefty amount of salt is very important as it infuses the chicken from the inside out. When I was experimenting, one of my batches came out tasting bland. I realized that even though the coating had salt and flavor, the chicken itself needed a boost of flavor. This was accomplished by marinating it in salt.</p><p>Also by adding sugar to the marinade gives it a touch of sweetness to balance out the saltiness. &nbsp;A touch of paprika gives it a smoky flavor without being too overpowering. &nbsp;Again, simple is best and too much paprika takes away from the chicken. A touch of garlic is also integral to the marinade. It is best to marinate the chicken tenders for about 4 hours to give the buttermilk time to do its job.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Chicken-Tenders-3.jpg alt="Fried Chicken Tenders Juicy, tender, marinated chicken dipped in coating and fried until perfectly crispy.

This is a simple dredge in flour method. I like to start off by coating the chicken tenders with flour, then in the whisked egg mixture, and then back into the flour again. &nbsp;This is the double coat method which yields itself to crunchy, crispy fried tenders. It is a little messy so be prepared to get your hands dirty!</p><p>To fry the chicken, it is important to use an instant-read thermometer. You can use peanut, vegetable or canola oils and bring to 350 degrees.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4239-1.jpg alt="Fried Chicken Tenders Juicy, tender, marinated chicken dipped in coating and fried until perfectly crispy.
