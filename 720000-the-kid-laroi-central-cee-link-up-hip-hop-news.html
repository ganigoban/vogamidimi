Cee shared a picture of the two together to his Instagram story over the weekend. The pair are sporting similarly simple all-black outfits and standing in front of a pretty plain background. There isn't much to glean from the photo itself but that didn't stop fans from speculating. Mostly they were wondering what a crossover between the two artists' very distinct styles would sound like.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Kid LAROI has been pretty quiet since around August. Trippie Red previewed some new music he made with LAROI to build up hype with fans. That paid off when he dropped Love Letter To You 5 where <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">LAROI appears on the song "Wind." </a>He stands among an already impressive feature list that also includes <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Roddy Ricch</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Bryson Tiller</a>, and many more. The most recent single LAROI has released is "Forever & Again." The track landed on the soundtrack for Greta Gerwig's massive summer blockbuster Barbie.

His debut album The First Time was rumored to drop earlier this year but ultimately never materialized. He described the sound of his new album in an Instagram post. It's supposed to include a variety of genres or as he says "rap sh*t, alternative sh*t, kind of pop sh*t on there, too, R&B.”&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If that wasn't enough to get fans excited LAROI also believes his new sound is his best yet. "It's the best material I've ever made," he confidently declares in the same Instagram post. He ends by thanking fans for staying with him over the long period between releases though he doesn't confirm when his new project could arrive.
