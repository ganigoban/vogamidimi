The video seemed like the perfect way to honor Affleck, because it showed a softer side of him and offered a glimpse into the life that the two share when no one is watching. Lopez's post comes three months after sites like <a href=#>The&nbsp;Cut</a> picked up stories on rumors that Affleck is super unhappy, thanks to his moody faces, and, of course, that one video of him looking miffed as he slammed a car door shut, which ended up going viral.</p><p>However, in Lopez's post, Affleck looks cool, calm, and collected, as he enjoys a drive with his wife. "Dear Ben ... Happy Birthday. I love you," the "Marry Me" star captioned the post. Of course, "Dear Ben" is a nod to Lopez's 2002 track that she wrote about her now-husband. You know, the one in which Lopez says that Affleck is "perfect"&nbsp;and calls him her "king." Anyway,&nbsp;fans loved every minute of J.Lo's post. "You two are the reason why I believe in true love," one <a href=#>Instagram</a> user commented. "This is too cute. You glow when you're with him. Happy birthday Ben,"&nbsp;another <a href=#>Instagram</a> comment read. No word on how Affleck feels about his wife sharing the video with her 250 million Instagram followers, but we can totally picture the face he's making right about now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtmbYZ4fo6jnKemmZuys3nLqKeesl2otbDD0mapmqqVYq%2BmuoyanZ%2BklZi4brTAqaeyZaOeu6i1zaBkr6GUmrxw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
