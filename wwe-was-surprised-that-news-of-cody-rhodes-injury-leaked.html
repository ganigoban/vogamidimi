Rhodes was covered in painful-looking bruising after tearing a pectoral muscle earlier in the week. News of Rhodes’ injury broke when he was<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> pulled from a scheduled house show match</a> over the weekend, which surprised many within WWE.</p><p>Despite having <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">severely torn his right pec</a>, Cody Rhodes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">insisted on wrestling</a> his scheduled match. Cody and Seth Rollins were able to put on a widely-praised bout that will be remembered for a long time due to the injury. WWE initially didn’t expect anyone to find out about Cody’s ailment until before the show.</p><p>At Saturday’s WWE live event in Champaign, Illinois, Cody was pulled from a scheduled match with Rollins. It was announced that he had been injured. Sean Sapp reported on a Fightful Select audio segment that WWE officials were not expecting that news to leak.</p><p>“Those close to him claim that Cody is set for surgery on Thursday. Now, anything can happen, obviously, but I seriously doubt that he’s going to blow off surgery. He’s going to address that tonight. I can tell you that people in WWE and near Cody were very surprised that this word emerged when it did.</p><p>I mean, when he missed the show and couldn’t wrestle, there were obviously people that were going to be poking around. So, I’m not sure why they were that surprised, but from what I understand, less than ten people knew about it.”</p><p>There was some speculation that Cody Rhodes’ injury might be a storyline. Ultimately, it made his match with Seth Rollins a classic. WWE was hoping for a bigger surprise by not announcing Cody’s injury until the last minute. In the age of the internet, it is shocking that nobody within the company thought results from a house show would be shared online.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
