But now, the&nbsp;former <a href=#>Disney star</a> dished&nbsp;about an incident that happened on the set of&nbsp;<a href=#>Hannah Montana</a>, and boy, is it awkward.</p><p>In a recent interview, the <a href=#>“Malibu”</a> singer told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a>, “I remember one time the producers on Hannah Montana started screaming at me ’cause they thought that I was smoking pot in the dressing room. And I was like, ‘I’m not f–king smoking pot in the dressing room. Go knock on my f–king dad’s door.’ It was my dad.” OMG.</p><p>Still, it’s not totally surprising that some people suspected it was Miley — especially&nbsp;considering she was desperate to shed her Disney image after several years of working on the hit series.</p><p>In a 2017 interview with the <a href=#>Zach Sang Show</a>, she said, “It’s a lot of time to be spent with my dad. You know, my dad was my dad on the show. I have enough dad time. That was really hard every day from, like, [ages] 11 to 18. I didn’t get a school escape like most people. I went to work with my dad. And then I started driving my dad toward the end, when I could start driving. And then my grandma went with me every day. It was a lot of time with dad and grandma.”</p><p>As we all know, all that dad and grandma time led to some of Miley’s wildest moments, including her <a href=#>2013 VMAs performance</a> and her entire&nbsp;<a href=#>Bangerz</a>&nbsp;era. But after so much time with&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Billy Ray Cyrus</a>&nbsp;</strong>on the set of a show that required her to be a role model 24/7, is it really that shocking that her career took the turn that it did?</p><p>“That’s why, as soon as I turned 18, you guys wonder why I was twerking at <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Juicy J</strong></a> shows. I had just spent 10 years every day with my dad and grandma,” she told Zach. “I had to break free.”</p><p>Still, that particular phase of Miley’s career angered a lot of people who once saw her as a wholesome <a href=#>Disney Channel star</a>. But now she wants fans to know that her intention was never to make people angry, but to get the opportunity to grow up and make mistakes just like everyone else.</p><p>She told Vanity Fair,&nbsp;“that wasn’t like a conscious thought of OK, I’m going to make sure right now is a good time for me to take that next step into adulthood and piss people off. It just felt right.”</p><p>These days, it seems like MiCy’s gone through it all and has now evolved into an adult with a good head on her shoulders. We mean, she’s still <a href=#>making music</a>, she recently <a href=#>got married</a> to&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Liam</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Hemsworth</strong></a>, and she’s always advocating for what she thinks is right. We don’t know about you, but after growing up in front of our eyes, we’re so glad to see she’s truly thriving.</p><p>Love J-14?
