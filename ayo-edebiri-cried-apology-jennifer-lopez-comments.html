And apparently, she broke down while apologizing to the superstar.</p><img alt="saturday night live episode 1855 pictured l r mikey day, sarah sherman, musical guest jennifer lopez, host ayo edebiri, surprise guest latto, devon walker, punkie johnson, surprise guest redman, and michael longfellow during the goodnights credits on saturday, february 3, 2024 photo by will heathnbc via getty images" title="Saturday Night Live - Season 49" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1977767341-65cbc1a4118d5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">NBC</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2024/film/features/jennifer-lopez-this-is-me-now-musical-film-ben-affleck-love-story-1235908364/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Variety</a> published today, the “Jenny From the Block” singer said that Edebiri—who took home an Emmy and a Golden Globe in January for her performance as Syd on Hulu’s The Bear—offered a sincere apology before the sketch comedy show aired. “She was mortified and very sweet,” Lopez said. “She came to my dressing room and apologized with tears in her eyes, saying how terrible it was that she had said those things. She felt really badly and loved my performance because we had just done my soundcheck and she actually got to hear me perform. She was just like, ‘I’m so fucking sorry, it was so awful of me.’”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So no hard feelings there. J.Lo even said she wasn’t too bothered by the comments in the first place: “It’s funny. I’ve heard similar things said about me throughout my career, so it really didn’t affect me.”</p><img alt="saturday night live episode 1855 pictured musical guest jennifer lopez, host ayo edebiri, and heidi gardner during promos in studio 8h on friday, february 2, 2024 photo by will heathnbc via getty images" title="Saturday Night Live - Season 49" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1973665681-65cbc1b423b26.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">NBC</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Edbiri's comments about Lopez, which she made on the Scam Goddess podcast in 2020, resurfaced a few weeks ago, after it was announced she would host SNL on February 3, the same night Lopez appeared as the musical guest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the clip, recorded ahead of J.Lo’s Super Bowl LIV halftime show performance with Shakira in February 2020, Edebiri told host Laci Mosley she believed Lopez’s music career was “one long scam.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Today I was actually thinking about one of my favorite scams of all time, because J.Lo is performing at the Super Bowl halftime show,” she said. “Her whole career is one long scam.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Edebiri went on to add, “Well, that’s the thing. She thinks she’s [singing] on multiple tracks, but it’s not her. I think she thinks that she’s still good even though, like, she’s not singing for most of these songs.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On her SNL episode, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a44878268/emma-seligman-bottoms-movie-interview-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bottoms star" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Bottoms star</a> also addressed the situation in a sketch, playing a contestant on a game show called Why’d You Say It? The show’s host questions Edebiri and the other contestants about rude or thoughtless comments they’ve posted on Instagram.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s wrong to leave mean comments or post comments just for clout, or run your mouth on a podcast because you don’t consider the impact because you're 24 and stupid,” Edebiri said, to cheers from the crowd.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lopez, meanwhile, simply took the stage that night to perform her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a45948003/jennifer-lopez-this-is-me-now-album-film-2024/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="new singles" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">new singles</a> “This Is Me … Now” and “Can’t Get Enough.” She did not publicly address Edebiri’s comments until the Variety interview.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
