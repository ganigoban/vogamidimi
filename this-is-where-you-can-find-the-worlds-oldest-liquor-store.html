England's Mount Gay Rum Distillery and Scotland's Glenturret Distillery, founded in 1703 and 1775 respectively, are impressive, but the winner for the oldest distillery in the world goes to North Ireland's Old Bushmills Distillery, as <a href=#>proclaimed on their website</a>. This whiskey brand was founded way before the liquor <a href=#>amassed popularity in the Wild West</a>: The company was founded in 1608 as King James I bestowed Sir Thomas Phillips a license to distill and produce. Despite generations of use, the location is still fully-functioning today. In fact, all of the whiskey currently bottled under the Bushmills brand is still manufactured there.</p><p>If that doesn't sound impressive enough, look no further than Weihenstephaner Brewery in Germany, which may have started brewing as far back as 768 A.D., according to <a href=#>Total Beverage Solution</a>. The brewery began as an abbey, which received its license to brew and sell beer in 1040. Not impressed yet? The location has been burned down four times, as explained by the <a href=#>Wine Warehouse</a>, was devastated by earthquakes and plagues, and is still in operation as of this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkG5ubmhfqbWqv4yiqmavmJq%2FpnnYqKxmm5Gjeqe1zZ1kraCVYsSwvsudqmannJmytMCMpaCqrZ%2BnerTAzqucaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
