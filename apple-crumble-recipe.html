I asked which apple recipe you wanted to see and an <strong>apple crumble recipe won by a landslide</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This Apple Crumble recipe is a quintessential Fall dessert. I just wish I was apple-picking in Vermont like I was a year ago. <span>Apple picking in Vermont on a crisp, cool, Fall day was just lovely and every bit as charming as I imagined in my mind</span>.</p><p>You wouldn’t believe how many apples I brought home in my suitcase from our apple-picking expedition. I baked up so many apple desserts as soon as I arrived back home. I had to cool down my house and light and pumpkin candle and pretend it felt like Fall outside.</p><p><span>My favorite apple dessert to make is fresh sliced apples tossed in cinnamon sugar and topped with a homemade buttery brown sugar pecan crumble</span>. It has the perfect amount of sweetness with a crunch from the pecans. The butter really comes through and makes the crumble so rich and buttery.</p><p>Now I get to share my best apple crumble recipe with you! It is so easy to throw together. I love to make it and pair it with vanilla bean ice cream. I even made <a href=#>homemade vanilla ice cream</a> to top the apple dessert and it was heavenly!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Crumble-Recipe-8-crop-720x806.jpg alt="Homemade Apple Crumble Recipe made with fresh apples tossed in cinnamon sugar and topped with a brown sugar crumble made with butter, pecans, brown sugar, and flour.

A Granny Smith apple is known for its tartness and will work beautifully in this recipe. Gala, Fuji, or Honeycrisp apples will work well too. Peel the apples and cut them into slices or chunks, depending on preference.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> — this recipe calls for granulated sugar. If you want a more molasses flavor, use brown sugar.</li><li><strong>Flour</strong> — this is what thickens the juices from the apples as they bake. May substitute cornstarch for the flour.</li><li><strong>Cinnamon</strong> — you can increase or reduce the cinnamon amount depending on taste.</li></ul><p><strong>Brown Sugar Pecan Crumble Recipe:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Salted Butter</strong> — I prefer salted butter in this recipe but if you have unsalted butter, add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the crumble recipe.</li><li><strong>Chopped Pecans</strong> — I like to buy pecan halves and roughly chop the pecans so there are varying shapes and sizes.</li><li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong> — this is what gives it sweetness and warmth from the molasses.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Flour</strong> — this is what keeps the shape of the crumble.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Crumble-Recipe-6-720x853.jpg alt="Homemade Apple Crumble Recipe made with fresh apples tossed in cinnamon sugar and topped with a brown sugar crumble made with butter, pecans, brown sugar, and flour.
