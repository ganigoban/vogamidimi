She added, "My distress only worsened when out of nowhere, [an actor] whispered in my ear if ‘he could stick it in’ while the cameras rolled. I said ‘no.’”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, a second woman also alleged that Bear-McClard reached out to her over Instagram (while he was still married to Ratajkowski) with promises to further her acting career. Describing an incident that reportedly happened at the former couple's shared Manhattan apartment, she told the publication, “Sebastian and I started kissing, Things escalated and then, without asking for my consent, Sebastian inserted himself inside me without using a condom.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Variety additionally stated that they spoke with "more than a dozen sources familiar with Bear-McClard's behavior."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ratajkowski filed for divorce from Bear-McClard in September 2022, and the exes are currently in an ongoing legal battle over the custody of their 2-year-old son, Sylvester Apollo Bear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">EmRata recently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spoke about her decision to end things with the film producer</a> during the Going Mental With Eileen Kelly podcast earlier this month. “I didn’t have the courage to leave for a long time. I was really, really unhappy,” she said of her relationship with Bear-McClard. "I was, like, 100 pounds and I had just had a baby. I got really skinny because I was not OK."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think so much of what I learned coming out of that relationship is to trust your instincts," she explained, adding: "Gaslighting is a real thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570p6Zmquknq6vecGemKtlnZiwra3RnWSsnaiqrq15zKKqnKeemcKkwIyao6Wdl5bBqrvNrGRwa2dofnWB</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
