Originally a sketch for SNL, the character of MacGruber premiered on the late night show in 2007 and was <a href=#>played by</a> Will Forte. The actor left SNL in 2010 and, after the MacGruber film premiered the same year, it seemed as though that would be the end of the character. However, Peacock has just announced that MacGruber will be returning as a television series for ten episodes.</p><p>Peacock released a <a href=#>promotional spot</a>, perfectly positioning the audience in the headspace to experience the character that Will Forte is most known for. The promo isn’t so much a trailer as it is a short film. You can watch the video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The six minute video updates the audience on where MacGruber is now, which happens to be jail. He’s imprisoned, we learn, for several murders and, of all things, war crimes. True to form, MacGruber has an aggressive comment for everything and is confident he will find a way to escape. Though the interview ends with MacGruber being dragged out of the room, the ten episode series is sure to bring Will Forte’s character out of prison so he can save America yet one more time.</p><p>This interview is framed like a documentary and immediately sets up the tone of the show in all its weirdness.<a href=#> Jorma Taccone</a>, the architect behind the MacGruber character, is set to return to write and direct the series. The series also has an impressive cast. Not only is Kristen Wiig set to star alongside Will Forte, but according to <a href=#>Collider</a> additional cast members will be Sam Elliott, Ryan Phillippe, Laurence Fishburne, and Billy Zane as the antagonist Enos Queeth.</p><p>It appears that the new series will be a good entry point for those too young to be aware of the sketch and the movie. Following the SNL sketch, MacGruber was also adapted into a movie in 2010. Starring Will Forte along with Kristen Wiig, Val Kilmer, and Ryan Philippe, the movie expanded on the sketch, as MacGruber attempts to take down national criminal Cunth (Val Kilmer.) The movie had a budget of $100,000 million was considered a failure as it didn’t even make its budget back. Now ten years later, MacGruber is back for more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/will-forte-macgruber-02-900x600.jpg><p>Will Forte’s MacGruber was a parody of ‘80s action films and the MacGyver television series starring Richard Dean Anderson. Like MacGruber, MacGyver depicted a secret agent who got out of hairy situations by making impossibly complicated objects to solve his conundrums out of household items.&nbsp;</p><p>MacGruber will be a trip down memory lane for some. Those familiar with the SNL sketch should be delighted to see Will Forte and Kristen Wiig back together. Both have continued to work in different realms. Wiig has most recently been in <a href=#>Wonder Woman 1984</a> and Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar. Forte appeared in Netflix’s Sweet Tooth where he portrayed Papa. Fans can relive their youth and catch Will Forte’s new show when it streams on December 16th.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ivmaG5brLOq6ueZaKawba%2BzWakmpuXp8KjsdFmoZqhnGLDqrDEqGWhrJ2h</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
