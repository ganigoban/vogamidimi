It isn’t like they haven’t happened before, quite the contrary. They just never seem to turn out all that well. Such is the life of a crime-fighting, caped crusader type who lives in a bat cave most of his daylight hours. That doesn’t mean directors and storytellers want to avoid it though, and that appears to have been part of the original plan with Zack Snyder’s Justice League. The director says he had in mind to have Bruce Wayne develop some serious feelings for just the wrong person. That’s right, he was going to <a href=#>fall in love</a> with Lois Lane.</p><p>Now, before you think this is totally off-base, sacrilege almost when it comes to comic book canon or even just a little ridiculous in the grand scheme of things, know Snyder had a plan here. Apparently, he wanted Bruce Wayne to develop feelings for Lois as a part of their original grieving process over the loss of Superman. And this love was going to have the Dark Knight beginning to think about bringing Superman back and getting the Justice League together.&nbsp;</p><p>Zack Snyder had this to say as part of <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> exclusive about the upcoming movie:</p><p>“The intention was that Bruce fell in love with Lois and then realized that the only way to save the world was to bring Superman back to life. So he had this insane conflict, because Lois, of course, was still in love with Superman. We had this beautiful speech where (Bruce) said to Alfred: ‘I never had a life outside the cave. I never imagined a world for me beyond this. But this woman makes me think that if I can get this group of gods together, then my job is done. I can quit. I can stop.’ And of course that doesn’t work out for him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wayne-3-900x506.png><p>Getting Bruce Wayne and Lois Lane together would seem a little awkward, especially when the rhyming last names are factored in. But I can see what Snyder is trying to do when it comes to drumming up conflict and tension around the cast. With superhero movies like this, especially ensemble ones trying to cover a lot of ground, it doesn’t make sense to start developing all new love interests just for the sake of making it happen. So developing that story within the framework of the current cast and making it both believable and having high stakes would probably work.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, it doesn’t seem like this will be the case for the Bruce Wayne love affair. According to the Vanity Fair article, the studio just wasn’t on board with this as a potential story arc for either character. This was probably for the best and it could have complicated a story that is already potentially wide-ranging and layered. That seems to be much of the goal with this latest Zack Snyder version: creating a more palatable story for this group than what we got with the Joss Whedon version.&nbsp;</p><p>Frankly, it’s kind of amazing that Zack Snyder’s Justice League is getting made and released at all. It’s been many years in the making after Snyder had to leave production from the original because of the death of his daughter. It was then that Joss Whedon took over, the story apparently changed dramatically and we got a film that flopped massively with critics. While this Bruce Wayne love revelation might not take shape, the new film surely will outperform the original, and is why there’s so much anticipation around the release.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/loislane-900x447.jpg><p>We’ll finally get to see Bruce Wayne and the rest of the Justice League crew on <a href=#>March 18th</a> when it’s released on HBO Max. Originally planned to come out in installments, it appears now it will just hit as a single feature-length film. And there are apparently a bunch of <a href=#>surprises</a> in order as well as a totally different feel if <a href=#>the trailer</a> is any indication. If there was a Bruce Wayne-Lois Lane romantic arc planned at some point, who knows what else is in store for this film which could prove to be an event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iaoqqwpnnWmrCnnV2hvKq%2FjKWYp51encGuuA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
