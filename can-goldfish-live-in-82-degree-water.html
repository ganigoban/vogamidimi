Goldfish require a sufficient amount of oxygen to survive, and an air pump helps to provide a constant flow of oxygen into the water. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Can I put ice cubes in my goldfish tank?</h2>Float a bag of ice or cold water in the fish tank to gently lower the water temperature. (Take care not to lower the temperature more than 2 or 3 degrees F in a 4-hour period.) Avoid putting ice cubes directly into your aquarium unless you make them with reverse osmosis or dechlorinated water. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on aqueon.com</a><h2>What is the lifespan of a goldfish?</h2>Goldfish can live for long periods of time if they are fed a varied diet and housed in proper water conditions.
