The icy blue Nocta Tech Fleece was introduced to the world through an Instagram photoshoot. In the pictures, Drake and about a dozen others sport the jacket on a runway and on the steps of a private jet. Clearly, people are paying attention as some of Drake's contemporaries rushed to the comments to praise his output. Rappers like Trippie Red and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Baby</a> hyped up not only the new drop but Drake as a whole creative force. In the captions, Drake clarifies exactly when fans will be able to get their hands on the new Nocta Tech Fleeces. "Nocta Tech Fleece available July 27th&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">@nike</a>."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Much of the recent news surrounding Drake has come from his ongoing "It's All A Blur" tour with 21 Savage. A few days ago Drake took the stage in Boston with former Nike athlete turned Jordan Brand star Jayson Tatum. Fans were so excited to see their all-star small forward on stage that some even <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">lost their balance and went tumbling</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-shows-off-new-nocta-tech-fleece>Drake Shows Off New Nocta Tech Fleece</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The most recent stop on the "It's All A Blur" tour saw the rapper pulling up for a pair of shows in Montreal. The biggest news of his stop was a surprise appearance from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a>. During their performance, Drake teased the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">opportunity of a future collab</a> between the pair. He also ignited, even more, beef, as he's done often on the tour. This time it was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">with fashion icon Anna Wintour</a> who he's historically not been a big fan of.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier on the tour he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">called out Childish Gambino directly</a>. He called the rapper's song "This Is America," which reportedly originated as a Drake diss, "overrated." He also made some comments that fans felt could even be a <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a> diss, though the lack of follow-up makes it feel like merely a miscommunication.
