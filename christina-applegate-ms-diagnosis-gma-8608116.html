I wake up, and I’m reminded of it every day. I might get to a place where I will function a little bit better. Right now, I’m isolating, and that’s kind of how I’m dealing with it, by not going anywhere,” she tells Roberts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In another <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>clip from the show, Applegate, 52, says,</a> “I live kind of in hell. I’m not out a lot, so this is a little difficult, just for my system. But … the support is wonderful, and I’m really grateful.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>says she “blacked out”</a> when she surprised the audience to present at the 2024 Emmy Awards. “I felt really beloved, and it was really a beautiful thing," she said, joking, “That audience stood up for everybody [though]."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her part, Sigler was diagnosed more than 20 years ago. The two women became friends after being introduced to each other by Lance Bass of NSYNC. "I wanted to give her tools and things that I've learned that have helped me," Sigler explained to People magazine. Applegate told the publication, “We haven't stopped talking since,” adding, "We have each other, and that's helped us so much.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Siegler and Applegate appeared on "Good Morning America" in part to help promote their new podcast, "MeSsy." “We would talk on the phone for two hours, and we'd be laughing and crying and we were like, "This is helping us. Let's record this. Let's do it," Applegate told People of their decision to start the podcast. The show premieres on March 19.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqGpoquknruiecCpp6Wdl5bBpnnMrGSdoZGcu7C%2FyKxkoKWRYoV3fJdqaG8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
