The former&nbsp;Desperate Housewives&nbsp;star enrolled at Chapman University, which accepted her into its scriptwriting program. "I started writing scripts at a really young age, and I tried a lot of different avenues," De La Garza told the Chapman Prowl. "It hit me when I applied to college: the best way for me to make any kind of difference or social change was to be a screenwriter, so that was the avenue I had to take."</p><p>De La Garza told the university publication that she wants to write science fiction (she called&nbsp;Black Mirror&nbsp;and The Twilight Zone her "biggest inspirations"), but her main goal is to make films about mental health. "That's the best way to get rid of stereotypes," she said. "The industry is guilty for creating a lot of stereotypes, but the industry can also break them."</p><p>The actress-turned-writer has already pitched an idea for a children's TV show to a network, and even though it didn't end up getting greenlit, she enjoyed the process a lot more than auditioning for roles. "That's when I knew this was the path for me," she added. We can't wait to see what she comes up with. Desperate Housewives&nbsp;in space, anyone? Eva Longoria told&nbsp;<a href=#>Fox News</a>&nbsp;that she's totally&nbsp;game for a reboot, so you never know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb3Fpa4FwsdWaZKWnnpy8s7XArGStrl2Zrrazx62cq2WUpLK0utNmo6inm2K5qrfEZpinsZ2kv6Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
