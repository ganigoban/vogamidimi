It certainly appeared that way.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Sources who chatted to The Sun (via the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>) said that Knight, who is a Princeton grad with an impressive salary of around $125,500 a year, was just what the actor needed after her devastating split from Matthew Janney. "Mack is just a normal, down-to-earth guy who has nothing to do with Hollywood, and Emma loves that," an insider said. "She was left really hurt by her break-up with Matthew and it's taken her more than a year to feel ready to start again with somebody."</p><p dir=ltr>When <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> asked Watson about her relationship with Knight, she outright refused to discuss him, arguing that doing so would be hypocritical of her and demeaning to her boyfriend. "I can't talk about my boyfriend in an interview, and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around," she insisted. "... In Hollywood, who you're dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show." After nearly two years together, the pair amicably parted ways in the spring of 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampnbIR2f46epKaZXayutb%2FOp6pmnJGptq%2BzjKGgrKyfp8Zw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
