She spent the next several years building her career on Israeli television, but it was her work on "Rabies" that gained her international attention. Still, it would be a few years before making the leap across the various ponds to work in North America. That opportunity finally came in 2013, when Grobglas was cast as America Singer in "The Selection."</p><p dir=ltr>While that series didn't pan out, a recurring role on "Reign" boosted her status significantly, and in 2014, she was cast as Petra on "Jane the Virgin." Grobglas' portrayal of Petra was quickly a fan-favorite. From one episode to the next, you couldn't tell if you should love or hate her due to the complex layering of Grobglas' performance. She created a unique character <a href=#>fans loved to hate</a> while simultaneously hated loving her, and the role was certainly a standout performance in the series.</p><p dir=ltr>Since "Jane the Virgin" came to an end, Grobglas has continued acting, but in a diminished capacity. She's only logged two roles, neither of which gained the kind of attention Petra did. Regardless, she appears to be spending most of her time with her family these days. In early 2020, <a href=#>People</a> reported that Grobglas and her husband, Artem Kroupenev, welcomed their first child, Arielle, into the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhpaX9yfI6wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkerW0xGaamqukYrynecmapZ5lpJ2ybsLIq56ipl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
