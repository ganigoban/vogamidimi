At Florida State University, he played both baseball and football (and also ran track). He excelled in football specifically, twice earning the title of All-American. In 1989, the Atlanta Falcons came calling, and he was selected fifth in the NFL draft that year. He also continued playing professional baseball, at first in the <a href=#>New York Yankees</a>' farm system and eventually making the big leagues.</p><p>By all rights, he was a significantly better football player than he was a baseball player (Brittanica describes his MLB career as "middling"), but nevertheless, over parts of his career, he was on both an NFL roster and an MLB roster at the same time. And though his baseball career was far shorter and less successful than his football one, he dutifully fulfilled his contracts to both leagues. That meant that on one occasion in 1992, he made history by suiting up for a baseball game and a football game on the same day, according to <a href=#>Bleacher Report</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j21vcG5iZLWww4ydnKKnnmLAorrDnqmsZZ2WsaZ5wairoWWdoa9urc2dZKeenGK1qr%2FTqKmyZZ%2BjerW0xGaqmqWVYrGixY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
