While working as a soundman on a series of films about England's infamous Miners' Strike, Heller met well-regarded <a href=#>Portuguese</a> <a href=#>Director</a> Eduardo Guedes. The two collaborated on what would become Heller's first writing credit, the 1994 film <i>Pax</i> starring <a href=#>Amanda Plummer</a>. ("Pax" is the acronym for the <a href=#>Portuguese</a> epitaph on gravestones.)</p><span>1993</span><p>In 1993, he married <a href=#>Miranda</a> Phillips Cowley, a senior vice <a href=#>President</a> at HBO; the couple have two children.</p><span>2009</span><p>In 2008, Heller created the hit CBS television series, <i>The Mentalist</i>, with his production company Primrose Hill Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. On 7 January 2009, the show won the award for "Favorite New TV Drama" at the 35th People's Choice Awards and since then, the star, Simon Baker has received several nominations for his portrayal of the lead character, Patrick Jane. Bruno Heller has acted as the series' showrunner from season 1 to season 6. He departed the show before season 7 to focus on his new show, Gotham.</p><span>2012</span><p>He left <a href=#>England</a> for New York, where he would meet his wife, <a href=#>Miranda</a> Cowley, granddaughter of the <a href=#>American</a> poet and critic Malcolm Cowley. After five years in the city, Heller moved to Los Angeles, where he worked on various television dramas including two projects for the USA Network: <i>Touching Evil</i> and <i>The Huntress</i>. But his breakthrough came with <i>Rome</i>, which he co-created. After the cancellation of that series for its high costs, Heller created <i>The Mentalist</i>. In September 2012, Heller sold a legal drama named <i>The Advocates</i> to CBS, which was written and executive produced by him, but the project finally did not go to series. In 2014 Heller created a TV series based on the Batman character James Gordon called <i>Gotham</i> for Fox Broadcasting Company.</p><span>2013</span><p>In 2013, Fox won a bidding war for a pilot set in Gotham written by Heller.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1960 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>Writers from London</a> <a href=#>Alumni of the University of Sussex</a> <a href=#>English television writers</a> <a href=#>English expatriates in the United States</a> <a href=#>English people of German-Jewish descent</a> <a href=#>Showrunners</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeSp8Kvu4yhnKWklad6r7HTZq6oqqSdenh8j3Jp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
