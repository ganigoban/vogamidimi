An easy and flavor-packed dinner!</p><p>We ate tin-foil dinners probably every single week growing up. Our tin&nbsp;foil dinners were usually made with ground beef, potatoes, carrots, onions, and a hefty sprinkle of salt and pepper. It is a comfort food meal that we all craved!&nbsp;To this day I am obsessed with foil packet dinners!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Sausage-Potato-Foil-Packets-7-1.jpg alt="Sausage Potato Foil Packets The modern tin-foil dinner with hardwood smoked sausage and creamy gold potatoes.

My husband and kids loved their foil packets so much that they requested I make them again ASAP. The secret is in the sausage. As the tin foil dinners cook in the oven, the sausage infuses the potatoes with so much FLAVOR.</p><p>It is such a simple dinner made with only sausage, potatoes, red onion, garlic powder, a pat of butter, and salt and pepper. The Sausage and Potato Tin-Foil Packets are definitely a quick and easy throw everything together kind of dinner. Plus you have the protein and vegetables all in one packet, which makes it so easy to have a balanced meal for your family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Sausage-Potato-Foil-Packets-1-1.jpg alt="Sausage Potato Foil Packets The modern tin-foil dinner with hardwood smoked sausage and creamy gold potatoes.

My favorite potatoes of all of the time are the <a href=# rel=noopener>Private Selection Petite Yukon Gold Potatoes</a>. They are the perfect size for these sausage&nbsp;foil packets. I cut them in half or quarter the potatoes before adding them into the foil packet. I prefer to use gold potatoes as they are much creamier in texture than a traditional russet potato.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kroger-Smoked-Sausage-and-Petite-Gold-Potatoes.jpg alt="Sausage Potato Foil Packets The modern tin-foil dinner with hardwood smoked sausage and creamy gold potatoes.

Since potatoes seem to soak in the seasonings, be generous with the salt and pepper. A pat of butter infuses the potatoes and makes a rich, creamy buttery sauce. You can even use the <a href=# rel=noopener>Private Selection Butter with Parmesan Cheese and Fresh Basil</a>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Sausage-Potato-Foil-Packets-2.jpg alt="Sausage Potato Foil Packets The modern tin-foil dinner with hardwood smoked sausage and creamy gold potatoes.

I place all of my foil packets on a baking sheet and bake in the oven at 400 degrees for about 35-40 minutes.</p><p>The key is to seal the foil tightly and let it cook completely covered. If you desire a little char on the sausage…and after the potatoes are fork tender…you can carefully open the foil packets and place under the broil setting for 2-3 minutes.</p><p>I am the biggest fan of Private Selection products at local Fry’s for years. I have tried so many different Private Selection products and have been so impressed with their quality and taste. I literally get so excited for their Private Selection sales and take that opportunity to fill up my refrigerator, freezer, and pantry!</p><p>I will be stocking up during the upcoming sale on Private Selection products from October 3-17. You can find over $50 worth of coupons and recipes found at <span><a href=# rel=noopener>Kroger Private Selection Site</a></span>. Also, download the Fry’s or your own Kroger store to download the Private Selection coupons right on your phone. It makes saving money so easy!</p><p>Your family will love this simple comfort food meal. It is one of our favorite dinners!</p><p><strong>Pin on PINTEREST:</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Sausage-Potato-Foil-Packets-Recipe.jpg alt="Sausage Potato Foil Packets The modern tin-foil dinner with hardwood smoked sausage and creamy gold potatoes.
