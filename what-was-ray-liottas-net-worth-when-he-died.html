Liotta worked consistently as an actor following "Goodfellas" and made appearances in films, television shows, and even video games. He is well known for his voice work for the main character in 2002's "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City," which went on to sell over 17 million copies (via <a href=#>Dextero</a>).</p><p>From 1997 to 2004, Liotta was married to Michelle Grace, the ex-wife of former MLB first basemen Mark Grace.

The actor reportedly owned another house in Pacific Palisades, as well as a property in Malibu.&nbsp;</p><p>Another revenue stream that Liotta had toward the end of his life involved commercial work.
