"I already did the scenes with the extensions up to the point where I had to cut off the hair," she explains, adding that Muschietti's original plan was to plant new strands of hair among her extensions so that she wouldn't have to cut her actual hair in the process. "But it wasn't really working," she admits. "It didn't really look real enough so he went all up and said, 'You know what? Just cut it all off. Hopefully you don't cut your hair or ruin it too much.' I didn't really have a choice, but I just said, 'OK. I'll do it.' I only had one take, because those were our only hair extensions and I just had to go on a cutting frenzy and cut it all off."</p><h4 class="ConsentBannerTitle-lgaGAH gOfech">Instagram content</h4><p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer" aria-label="Opens in a new window" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BaseLink-eNWuiM ConsentBannerLink-dJZMSz iUEiRd dmmjqX ldFMAi">originates</a> from.</p><p>A major haircut would give anyone the shivers, but Sophia's since updated the self-styled crop into an even shorter pixie cut. But what really scares the actress off-screen? "I think it's failure and letting people down," she says. "There's scenes where I really want to get things right and all the kids know me as the person who says, 'Sorry.' I think I've gotten a lot better with that, but it's still the thing that I'm still worried about, trying to get the scene perfect."</p><p>Up next for Sophia is Sharp Objects, an HBO adaptation of the Gillian Flynn novel helmed by To the Bone's <a href=#>Marti Noxon</a>. She plays the younger version of Camille, a reporter who must contend with — you guessed it — the demons lurking in her past.</p><p>"To be honest, I think I would like a really fun, quirky character with an interesting background," Sophia muses of what future roles she'd like to take on. "I would like a comedy," she adds with a laugh. "A comedy would be nice."</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>We Tested It Star Finn Wolfhard on Classic ‘80s Horror Flicks and It Went SO WRONG</a></p><figure class="CneVideoEmbedFigure-kCfJjN jAaUmm cne-video-embed"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHEp62on6Wae6S7zGiqraeirny0u8%2BhoJplnJ65rbXSZqCnrJWnw6qx1magrWWdpMOqsYycrK2smaO0brTEq2ShmZmneqO1y6VkrKORp8CordGd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
