Stamos seems to believe that this dynamic contributed to their divorce. "It was very much the opinion that she dumped me because her career was going great and mine wasn't, and that's humiliating,"&nbsp;Stamos shared in his memoir. "I don't blame her for it. It was just the perception that people took, and maybe they weren't wrong. She was doing great at the time and I wasn't."</p><p>This stance is slightly different from Stamos' previous comments denying that their careers caused their divorce. "Everybody thought that she dumped me [because] her career was on fire and mine wasn't," Stamos shared with People in 2009 (via <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>). "But that wasn't the case."&nbsp;Elsewhere in the memoir, Stamos recounted a phase when he hated Romijn and revealed that the feelings had a profound effect on him. Stamos also accused Romijn and her friends of looking down on him. "She makes it clear that I'm the TV guy and she's the newly minted star," Stamos wrote. "Somewhere deep inside, I start to believe it."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjZYRyg46wn5qsXZ%2B8qbqMrKuapZ%2BoeqO4wKacrGWUnsOwvsKeZKudkpqwpK2Mq6amoZqjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
