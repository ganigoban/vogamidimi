The new talent was cast in recurring roles on two TV shows: "Gilmore Girls" and "Dawson's Creek." Murray soon landed a part in the major motion picture "Freaky Friday," playing the motorcycle-riding "bad boy" Jake, whom Anna had a crush on. Of course, when Anna inhabits her mother's body, Murray primarily works opposite Jamie Lee Curtis. Even after Murray began his six-season run on "One Tree Hill," the actor starred alongside Hilary Duff in "A Cinderella Story" in 2004 and was in the slasher film "House of Wax" in 2005. That year, Murray married actor Sophia Bush, but the couple divorced the following year.</p><p dir=ltr>Following "One Tree Hill," Murray hit a bit of a lull, which may have had something to do with his reported behavior at the time, per <a href=#>E! News</a>. Murray told the outlet, "I was just living my life, going out, and I changed everything." He added, "When you're young and you're thrown into something that I was definitely not ready for â€” I'm human and screw up." In 2012, he returned to "One Tree Hill" for an episode in the final season. <a href=#>Murray met actor Sarah Roemer</a> when they were both on Crackle's "Chosen." The <a href=#>happy couple</a> married in 2015, and they have two children.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2021, Murray played serial killer Ted Bundy in "Ted Bundy: American Boogeyman," and for 2023, he's already set to appear in <a href=#>"Sullivan's Crossing."</a>&nbsp;The star has been the leading man in a number of Christmas rom-coms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmaINzgY5rZ2axlZa%2FtHnAn6ueql2bv6atyrJkn6qZma66edahnKudXZ7AbsDHnmScmaOpeq%2B71mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogH - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
