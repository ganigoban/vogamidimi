Now, Logan Paul is United States Champion, and <a href=#>he claims to be retired from boxing</a>. That being said, WWE has certain rules and he promised to follow one very interesting request from Triple H.</p><p>Logan Paul has had a lot of fun as US Champion so far. <a href=#>He took shower in his title, and caused</a> a lot of eyes to look his way with those scandalous photos.</p><p>While speaking to his brother Jake Paul, Logan Paul joked that he “f*cks in this belt.” Then he had to stop himself to make it clear that he actually wasn’t doing the nasy in his United States Title.</p><p>Logan Paul got a bit serious as he came clean about something Triple H apparently told him about that title belt, and what not to do in it.</p><p>“I swear Triple H, he came up to me he said ‘Logan congratulations on the belt, one thing we’ve really been cautious about here in the organization is making our athletes are not f*cking in their belts.’ And I gave him my word.”</p><p>The idea of having sex in a title belt is a common joke, and the term “breaking in your belt” has been used to describe this action. Apparently, WWE frowns on that activity, and it’s not hard to see why.</p><p>WWE has already seen a video leak show off a NSFW activity in the NXT Women’s Title belt, thanks to Saraya. The company doesn’t want to run any risk at all of that history repeating itself at all. If anything, Logan Paul promised Triple H that he would stick to the code of holding a WWE Championship.</p><p>You can check out the video below to see Logan Paul and Jake Paul’s little interaction. This included The Maverick coming clean about that frank conversation he had with Triple H about having sex in the United States Title belt.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on this rule about WWE Title belts?
